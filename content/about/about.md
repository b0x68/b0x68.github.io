My name is Brian and this is my personal blog. The content will mostly be tech related -- Linux, web development, How To articles, etc. I can also guarantee there will be completely random and unrelated content. By day I am a linux infrastructure administrator; by night, I'm a serial hobbyist.

I don't claim to be an expert on anything, but I'll share my experiences in hope they help others.

* Some notable strengths:
  * Enterprise/RPM based Linux -- RHEL, Springdale, CentOS, Rocky
  * Software:
    * Languages: bash, Python, Go(lang), Puppet
    * Git
    * CAS
    * OpenDJ, LDAP, Duo
    * Apache, Passenger, Web frameworks
    * HPC cluster administration -- SLURM, NVidia, Jobstats
    * NFS, CIFS
    * Docker, Apptainer(Singularity)
  * Interests
