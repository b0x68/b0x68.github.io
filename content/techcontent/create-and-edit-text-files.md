# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Create and Edit Text Files

In this tutorial, we will dive into the essential skills required for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200 objective: Creating and Editing Text Files. This objective evaluates your proficiency in managing text files efficiently, a fundamental skill for system administrators working with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have:

- A working installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Access to a terminal or command-line interface
- Basic familiarity with navigating the Linux file system

## Objective Overview

The objective "Create and Edit Text Files" evaluates your ability to perform tasks such as creating, viewing, and modifying text files using command-line text editors like `vim` or `nano`. Additionally, you should be comfortable using redirection and pipes to manipulate text files effectively.

## Creating Text Files

To create a new text file, you can use the `touch` command followed by the file name. For example, to create a file named `example.txt`, simply type:

```bash
touch example.txt
```

This command will create an empty text file named `example.txt` in the current directory.

## Editing Text Files

### Using Vim

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a powerful command-line text editor available on most Unix-like systems, including RHEL. To edit a text file using Vim, follow these steps:

1. Open the file in Vim by typing `vim` followed by the file name:

    ```bash
    vim example.txt
    ```

2. Press `i` to enter insert mode, allowing you to type and edit the text.
3. Once you've made your changes, press `Esc` to exit insert mode.
4. To save the changes and exit Vim, type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

### Using Nano

[Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) is a beginner-friendly command-line text editor that is also available on RHEL. To edit a text file using Nano, follow these steps:

1. Open the file in Nano by typing `nano` followed by the file name:

    ```bash
    nano example.txt
    ```

2. Edit the text as needed.
3. To save the changes and exit Nano, press `Ctrl + O`, then press `Enter`. To exit Nano without saving, press `Ctrl + X`.

## Viewing Text Files

To view the contents of a text file without modifying it, you can use the `cat` command. For example, to display the contents of `example.txt`, type:

```bash
cat example.txt
```

This will output the contents of the file directly to your terminal.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the essential skills required to create and edit text files on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. By mastering these techniques and practicing regularly, you'll be well-prepared to tackle the "Create and Edit Text Files" objective of the RHCSA Exam 200. Happy scripting!
