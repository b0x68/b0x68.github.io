I'm brand new to HUGO and this is my version of 'how to with HUGO as a beginner'. My first post will be a walk through of how I went about spinning up this site.

# _What_ is HUGO?

> TLDR: _Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again_.

If you really want to learn about HUGO, you should [head on over to their official site.](https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/)

I can confirm; HUGO makes _learning_ website creation bearable. Admittedly, I'm not very interested in the low-level intricacies of front end languages, so using HUGO, where there are many fully-fledged themes freely available and the integration of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), makes this type of project _fun_ and easy :) Understandably, your definition of fun may vary! 

I acknowledge some custom HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript work will need to be done if you're not completely satisfied with your theme's look and feel. A future post, perhaps.

# My Environment
  * MacOS Ventura 13.0
  * Go(lang) version go1.19.4 darwin/amd64
  * Hugo v0.108.0+extended darwin/amd64

  Keep in mind, there are many options for what your environment can be, e.g., Docker, Vagrant, a VM, Cloud based, etc. These are outside the scope of this article, but you can easily web search this information and choose your desired setup.
* Software

# Let's Begin

Okay, so first, I make a dev environment in my `~/projects/` directory.

```bash
mkdir ~/projects/hugo

hugo new site blog-dev

cd blog-dev

# git init for later when we push to github
git init

git submodule add https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal themes/terminal

# edit line "theme = 'terminal'" in editor \
# of your choice. Mine is vim
vim config.toml

# now let's test to make sure it's working
hugo server --port 1313
```

```terminal
# sample output of local webserver on successful startup

Start building sites â€¦
