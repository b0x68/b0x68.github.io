# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam Objective: Log in and switch users in multiuser targets

In this tutorial, we'll explore the crucial skill of logging in and switching users within multiuser targets, a key objective of the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam200. This skill is fundamental for efficiently managing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system, especially in multiuser environments.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure that you have:

- A Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (either a physical machine or a virtual machine).
- Valid credentials to log in to the system.

## Logging In

### Step 1: Open a Terminal

To begin, open a terminal on your Red Hat system. You can do this by using the terminal emulator or pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` on the keyboard.

### Step 2: Enter Login Credentials

Once the terminal is open, you will be prompted to log in. Enter your username and password when prompted. Ensure that you are aware of the correct credentials to successfully log in.

```bash
$ login: your_username
$ password: your_password
```

After entering the correct credentials, press `Enter` to log in.

## Switching Users

### Step 3: Use the `su` Command

To switch users in a multiuser environment, the `su` (switch user) command is your go-to tool. To switch to another user, type the following command:

```bash
$ su - username
```

Replace `username` with the name of the user to whom you want to switch. The `-` option ensures that the environment variables are set to those of the specified user.

### Step 4: Enter User Password

After executing the `su` command, you will be prompted to enter the password of the target user. Type the password and press `Enter`. If the password is correct, you will be switched to the specified user.

```bash
Password: target_user_password
```

## Exiting User Session

### Step 5: Return to the Original User

To return to the original user, simply type the `exit` command and press `Enter`. This will close the current user's session and take you back to the previous user.

```bash
$ exit
```

## Conclusion

Mastering the art of logging in and switching users in multiuser targets is essential for effective system administration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This skill will not only serve you well in the RHCSA Exam200 but also in real-world scenarios where efficient user management is critical.

Now that you have successfully learned how to log in, switch users, and exit user sessions, you are one step closer to becoming a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator. Practice these commands on your system to solidify your understanding and enhance your system administration skills. Good luck!
