## What is SRE?
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that blends software engineering and operations to create scalable and highly reliable software systems. Originally pioneered by Google, SRE is now widely adopted across various industries to improve service reliability and operational efficiency.

## Core Principles of SRE
1. **Embrace Risk** – Manage acceptable levels of risk effectively.
2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** – Define and measure system performance targets.
3. **Eliminate Toil** – Automate repetitive and manual tasks.
4. **Monitoring and Observability** – Implement effective monitoring practices.
5. **Incident Response** – Develop structured incident response processes.
6. **Blameless Postmortems** – Learn from failures without assigning blame.
7. **Continuous Improvement** – Optimize systems through iterative improvements.

## Skills and Competencies

### Technical Skills
1. **Programming and Scripting** – Proficiency in Python, Go, and Bash.
2. **System Administration** – Strong Linux/Unix knowledge, performance tuning.
3. **Networking** – Understanding of protocols, load balancers, firewalls, and DNS.
4. **Cloud Computing** – Experience with AWS, GCP, and Azure.
5. **Monitoring and Observability** – Familiarity with Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
6. **CI/CD and Automation** – Use of Jenkins, GitLab CI, Ansible, Puppet, and Chef.
7. **Containers and Orchestration** – Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes.
8. **Database Management** – Expertise in SQL/NoSQL databases, performance tuning.

### Soft Skills
1. **Problem-Solving** – Strong analytical and troubleshooting skills.
2. **Communication** – Clear and concise communication, documentation proficiency.
3. **Collaboration** – Ability to work in cross-functional teams.
4. **Time Management** – Efficient multitasking and prioritization.
5. **Adaptability** – Willingness to learn new technologies.
