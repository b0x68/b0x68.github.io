# Tech Tutorial: Manage Security Using SELinux Boolean Settings

## Introduction

In the world of Linux security, SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) stands out as a powerful tool for enforcing security policies. One of the flexible features of SELinux is the use of boolean settings, which allows administrators to fine-tune the security policy without the need to modify or recompile policy sources. This tutorial will guide you through the process of managing SELinux boolean settings to modify system security policies effectively.

## What is SELinux?

SELinux is a security module integrated into various Linux distributions. It provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies. This includes a set of rules that dictate how processes can access files, other processes, and system resources. It can operate in either enforcing mode, where rules are enforced, or permissive mode, where rules are only logged.

## SELinux Booleans

SELinux booleans are a type of policy setting that can be toggled on or off to enable or disable certain SELinux policies. These booleans allow system administrators to modify the behavior of the policy without requiring in-depth knowledge of the policy language.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Checking Current SELinux Status

Before modifying any SELinux settings, it's crucial to understand the current state of SELinux on your system. Use the following command to check whether SELinux is enabled and its current mode:

```bash
sestatus
```

### Step 2: Listing Available SELinux Booleans

To see what SELinux booleans are available on your system, you can use the `getsebool` command. To list all booleans, you can run:

```bash
getsebool -a
```

### Step 3: Understanding Boolean Settings

Each boolean controls a specific aspect of system behavior under SELinux policy. For instance, the `httpd_can_network_connect` boolean determines whether HTTPD (Apache) can make network connections. 

To check the current state of a specific boolean, use:

```bash
getsebool httpd_can_network_connect
```

### Step 4: Modifying SELinux Booleans

To change the value of a SELinux boolean, you use the `setsebool` command. For example, to allow HTTPD to make network connections, you would run:

```bash
setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on
```

To make the change persistent across reboots, add the `-P` flag:

```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on
```

### Step 5: Verifying the Changes

After modifying SELinux boolean settings, it's good practice to verify that the changes have been applied correctly. Use `getsebool` again to confirm:

```bash
getsebool httpd_can_network_connect
```

## Detailed Code Examples

Let's consider a scenario where you need to configure a system to allow the DHCP client daemon (`dhclient`) to update the `/etc/resolv.conf` file, which is typically managed by NetworkManager.

1. **Check the current boolean setting**:
   ```bash
   getsebool dhclient_use_etc_rw
   ```

2. **Enable the boolean**:
   ```bash
   setsebool -P dhclient_use_etc_rw on
   ```

3. **Verify the setting**:
   ```bash
   getsebool dhclient_use_etc_rw
   ```

This sequence of commands ensures that `dhclient` can modify `/etc/resolv.conf` when necessary, adhering to SELinux policies.

## Conclusion

SELinux booleans offer a powerful, flexible way to manage security policies on Linux systems without needing deep expertise in SELinux policy writing. By understanding and using these boolean settings, system administrators can ensure their systems are secure while still allowing necessary services to function correctly. As demonstrated, modifying SELinux settings is a straightforward process that can significantly impact system behavior and security. Regularly reviewing and adjusting SELinux booleans should be part of your system security management practices.
