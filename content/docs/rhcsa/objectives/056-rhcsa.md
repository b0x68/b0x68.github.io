# Tech Tutorial: Manage Security with SELinux Contexts

## Introduction

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a mandatory access control (MAC) security mechanism implemented in the Linux kernel. It is designed to enhance the security of Linux systems by allowing administrators to have more control over who can access the system. SELinux can operate in either enforcing mode, where it enforces the policy and denies access based on policy rules, or permissive mode, where it does not enforce policies but logs actions that would have been denied.

SELinux policies help control the interaction between processes and files, ensuring that only authorized processes can access specific files or resources. One fundamental aspect of SELinux is its use of contexts, which are labels attached to every process and file in the system. These labels or contexts are what SELinux uses to make access control decisions.

This tutorial focuses on how to list and identify SELinux file and process contexts, which is essential for system administrators managing security on Linux systems.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Checking SELinux Status

Before working with SELinux contexts, you should check the status of SELinux on your system to ensure it is enabled and in the correct mode.

```bash
sestatus
```

This command will show you whether SELinux is enabled and the current mode it is operating in.

### Step 2: Understanding SELinux Contexts

Every file, process, and resource in an SELinux-enabled system has an associated SELinux context. This context is a string that contains several components:

- **User**: The SELinux user identity.
- **Role**: The role that constrains the user.
- **Type**: The type of the object, which is used in defining rules in the policy.
- **Level**: This is optional and used in MLS (Multi-Level Security) policies.

The format of an SELinux context is:

```plaintext
user:role:type:level
```

### Step 3: Listing SELinux Contexts for Files

To view the SELinux context for files, use the `-Z` option with `ls`.

```bash
ls -Z /path/to/directory
```

This will display the SELinux contexts associated with each file in the specified directory.

#### Detailed Code Example

Suppose you want to check the SELinux context of the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
ls -Z /etc/passwd
```

Output might look like this:

```plaintext
system_u:object_r:passwd_file_t:s0 /etc/passwd
```

### Step 4: Viewing SELinux Contexts of Running Processes

To view the SELinux context of running processes, use the `-Z` option with `ps`.

```bash
ps auxZ
```

This displays the SELinux context for each process running on the system.

#### Detailed Code Example

If you want to find the SELinux context of the Apache HTTP server process:

```bash
ps auxZ | grep httpd
```

Output:

```plaintext
system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0    root     2456  0.0  4.2 142536 21508 ?        Ss   10:20   0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd
```

### Step 5: Managing and Changing SELinux Contexts

Changing the SELinux context of a file can be done using the `chcon` command. However, it's important to understand that such changes might be temporary if not updated in the SELinux policy.

```bash
chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /path/to/new/webpage
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and managing SELinux contexts are crucial for maintaining the security of a Linux system. By correctly labeling files and processes, administrators can ensure that only authorized interactions occur within the system. Remember, while SELinux can seem complex, its robust framework significantly enhances the security of Linux systems. It's essential to practice and become familiar with SELinux commands and contexts to manage your systems effectively.
