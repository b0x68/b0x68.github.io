# Tech Tutorial: Run Playbooks with Automation Content Navigator

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use the Automation Content Navigator to manage and run Ansible playbooks effectively. The Automation Content Navigator is a powerful tool designed to organize and control automation content, making it easier to deploy and manage applications across various environments. We'll focus on how to create inventories and configure the Ansible environment to streamline your automation tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following:
- Access to an Automation Content Navigator instance.
- Ansible installed on your local machine or the server where you'll run the playbooks.
- Basic knowledge of YAML and Ansible playbook structure.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Automation Content Navigator

First, log in to your Automation Content Navigator interface. The URL and credentials should be provided by your system administrator.

### Step 2: Create a New Inventory

Inventories in Ansible define the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Here's how to create one in the Automation Content Navigator:

1. Navigate to the "Inventories" section on the dashboard.
2. Click on “Create Inventory”.
3. Enter a name and description for your inventory.
4. Optionally, specify variables that apply to all hosts within this inventory.

#### Example:
```yaml
all:
  vars:
    ansible_user: admin
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /path/to/key
```

5. Save the inventory.

### Step 3: Add Hosts to Your Inventory

After creating your inventory, you need to add hosts:

1. Open the inventory you created.
2. Click on “Add Host”.
3. Enter the host details such as IP address or hostname, and any host-specific variables.

#### Example:
```yaml
hosts:
  192.168.1.1:
    ansible_host: 192.168.1.1
    ansible_user: root
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /path/to/individual/host/key
```

4. Repeat the process for each host you want to include in the inventory.

### Step 4: Configure the Ansible Environment

Before running a playbook, ensure your Ansible environment is correctly configured to use the settings defined in your Automation Content Navigator.

1. Configure global settings by navigating to the “Settings” menu in Automation Content Navigator.
2. Set up environment variables such as `ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False` and any other necessary parameters.

### Step 5: Create and Run a Playbook

Now, create a playbook in the Automation Content Navigator:

1. Go to the "Playbooks" section.
2. Click on “Create Playbook”.
3. Define your playbook with tasks using YAML format.

#### Example Playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Test Connection
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping all hosts
      ping:
```

4. After creating the playbook, select the inventory you created earlier.
5. Run the playbook by clicking “Execute”.

### Step 6: Monitor Execution

Monitor the execution of your playbook within the Automation Content Navigator:

1. Go to the “Execution Environments” section.
2. View detailed logs and status of the playbook execution.

## Detailed Code Examples

Here's a more complex example of a playbook created in the Automation Content Navigator:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
  hosts: web_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install apache2
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present

    - name: Start apache2 service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

In this example, we target a group called `web_servers`, escalate privileges to perform tasks, install Apache, and ensure it's running.

## Conclusion

The Automation Content Navigator simplifies managing and executing Ansible playbooks by providing a user-friendly interface for creating inventories, configuring environments, and monitoring playbook executions. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can enhance your automation strategies and ensure consistent and efficient management of your infrastructure.

Experiment with different configurations and tasks to fully leverage the capabilities of Automation Content Navigator in your projects.
