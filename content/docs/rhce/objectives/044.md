# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible Modules for Storage Devices

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to automate common tasks related to storage devices, a crucial aspect of the RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) exam, using Ansible. Ansible is a powerful configuration management and orchestration tool that simplifies the process of managing servers.

Automating storage management tasks can significantly increase the efficiency, accuracy, and reproducibility of system configurations. We will focus specifically on tasks such as adding, partitioning, formatting, and mounting storage devices using Ansible modules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following setup:
- A control node with Ansible installed (version 2.9 or later recommended).
- One or more managed nodes (Linux-based) where storage tasks will be performed.
- Root or sudo access on the managed nodes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Configure Ansible

First, make sure your Ansible control node can communicate with the managed nodes. Create or edit the `/etc/ansible/hosts` inventory file to include the IP addresses or hostnames of your managed nodes under a group `[storage_nodes]`.

```ini
[storage_nodes]
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
```

### Step 2: Discover Current Storage Devices

To begin managing storage devices, we first need to gather information about the current state of disks on the managed nodes. We'll use the `ansible.builtin.command` module to list all disks.

Create a playbook called `list_disks.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: List all connected storage devices
  hosts: storage_nodes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: List disks
      ansible.builtin.command: lsblk
      register: result

    - name: Print disks
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ result.stdout }}"
```

Run the playbook using:

```bash
ansible-playbook list_disks.yml
```

### Step 3: Partition a New Disk

Assuming you have a new disk `/dev/sdb` that needs partitioning:

Create a playbook called `partition_disk.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Partition new disk
  hosts: storage_nodes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Partition /dev/sdb
      community.general.parted:
        device: /dev/sdb
        number: 1
        state: present
        part_end: 100%
```

This playbook uses the `community.general.parted` module to partition the disk `/dev/sdb`.

### Step 4: Create a Filesystem

Next, format the new partition with an ext4 filesystem:

Create a playbook called `format_partition.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Format partition with ext4
  hosts: storage_nodes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create ext4 filesystem on /dev/sdb1
      ansible.builtin.filesystem:
        fstype: ext4
        dev: /dev/sdb1
```

### Step 5: Mount the Filesystem

Finally, ensure the new filesystem is mounted on `/mnt/data`:

Create a playbook called `mount_filesystem.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Mount the filesystem
  hosts: storage_nodes
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure /mnt/data directory exists
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /mnt/data
        state: directory

    - name: Mount /dev/sdb1 on /mnt/data
      ansible.builtin.mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        src: /dev/sdb1
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted
        opts: defaults
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to automate several essential storage management tasks using Ansible. By leveraging Ansible modules like `parted`, `filesystem`, and `mount`, you can efficiently manage disk space on your servers, a key skill for any system administrator, especially those preparing for the RHCSA exam.

Automation not only saves time but also reduces the possibility of human error, ensuring consistency across your infrastructure. As you progress, consider exploring other Ansible modules and capabilities to further enhance your automation skills.
