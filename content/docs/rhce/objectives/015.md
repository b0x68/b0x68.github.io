# Tech Tutorial: Understanding Core Components of Ansible - Handling Task Failure

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that is widely used for configuration management and application deployment. One of its key features is its ability to handle failures gracefully during the execution of playbooks. Managing task failures effectively is crucial in maintaining the stability and reliability of systems in production environments. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of handling task failures in Ansible, ensuring that automation scripts are robust and fault-tolerant.

## Step-by-Step Guide

In this section, we will explore the different strategies and mechanisms provided by Ansible to handle task failures.

### Step 1: Understanding Failure in Ansible

Before diving into handling failures, it's essential to understand what constitutes a failure in an Ansible context. A task in Ansible is considered failed when it returns a non-zero exit status, which typically indicates an error or undesirable outcome. This can halt the execution of the playbook, potentially leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

### Step 2: Using `ignore_errors`

One of the simplest ways to handle errors is by using the `ignore_errors` directive. This directive tells Ansible to continue executing the rest of the playbook even if a task fails.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Attempt to remove a non-existent file
  ansible.builtin.command: rm /path/to/nonexistent/file
  ignore_errors: yes
```

In this example, even if the file does not exist and the command fails, Ansible will not halt the playbook execution.

### Step 3: Implementing `failed_when`

The `failed_when` condition allows you to define custom conditions under which a task should be considered failed.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Check free disk space
  ansible.builtin.shell: df -h / | awk 'NR==2{print $4}'
  register: disk_space
  failed_when: "'10G' not in disk_space.stdout"
```

Here, the task is marked as failed if the available disk space does not contain '10G'. This is useful for creating more dynamic failure conditions based on the output of the task.

### Step 4: Using `rescue` in Blocks

Ansible blocks allow you to group tasks together and handle errors more efficiently with a `rescue` section.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Handle errors with blocks
  block:
    - name: Install a package
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: somepackage
        state: present
  rescue:
    - name: Attempt recovery on failure
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: anotherpackage
        state: present
```

If the first task fails, the tasks in the `rescue` section will be executed, allowing for error recovery.

### Step 5: Retry with `retries` and `until`

For transient errors, such as network timeouts, you might want to retry the task multiple times.

**Example:**

```yaml
- name: Retry downloading a file
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: http://example.com/file.tar.gz
    dest: /tmp/file.tar.gz
  register: result
  until: result is succeeded
  retries: 5
  delay: 10
```

This task will retry downloading the file up to 5 times with a 10-second delay between retries.

## Detailed Code Examples

Letâ€™s consider a real-world scenario where you need to configure a database server and handle potential failures:

**Example playbook:**

```yaml
---
- name: Configure database server
  hosts: db_servers
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install MySQL
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: mysql-server
        state: present
      ignore_errors: yes

    - name: Start MySQL service
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: mysqld
        state: started
      failed_when: "'FAILED' in result.stderr"

    - block:
        - name: Ensure database 'myapp' exists
          mysql_db:
            name: myapp
            state: present
      rescue:
        - name: Send failure notification
          slack:
            token: "{{ slack_token }}"
            msg: "Failed to create database on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
```

## Conclusion

Handling task failures is a critical aspect of writing robust Ansible playbooks. By using strategies such as `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, `rescue` blocks, and retry mechanisms, you can ensure that your automation is resilient and can cope with unexpected errors. These techniques not only help in maintaining system stability but also in automating recovery procedures, making your infrastructure automation more reliable.
