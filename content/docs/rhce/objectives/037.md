# Tech Tutorial: Create Ansible Plays and Playbooks

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. One of the powerful features of Ansible is the ability to use conditionals to control the execution flow of plays and tasks within playbooks. Conditionals are a fundamental part of writing efficient and effective Ansible playbooks. They allow you to execute different tasks based on certain conditions, making your automation smarter, more flexible, and more adaptive to different environments.

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to use conditionals in Ansible plays and playbooks. We will walk through various scenarios where conditionals are beneficial, along with detailed code examples.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Basic Conditionals with `when`

The `when` statement is used to control whether a particular task will execute based on the condition given. It evaluates a condition at runtime and decides the next step accordingly.

#### Example: Checking for OS Family

You might need to perform certain tasks based on the operating system of the host. Here's how you can use the `when` statement to check the OS family.

```yaml
---
- name: Check OS Family
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install curl on Debian family
      apt:
        name: curl
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"

    - name: Install curl on RedHat family
      yum:
        name: curl
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
```

In this playbook, Ansible checks the OS family and installs `curl` using the appropriate package manager.

### 2. Using Conditionals with Loops

Conditionals can be particularly useful when combined with loops. You can decide to execute a task for certain items in a loop.

#### Example: User Management

Suppose you want to create users on a system, but some users require a specific shell.

```yaml
---
- name: Create users with specific shells
  hosts: all
  vars:
    users:
      - name: alice
        shell: /bin/bash
      - name: bob
        shell: /bin/zsh
      - name: charlie

  tasks:
    - name: Create users with bash shell
      user:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        shell: "{{ item.shell | default('/bin/sh') }}"
      loop: "{{ users }}"
      when: item.shell is defined and item.shell == '/bin/bash'
```

Here, only `alice` will have the `/bin/bash` shell as specified, while `bob` and `charlie` will default to `/bin/sh`.

### 3. Combining Conditionals

You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.

#### Example: Managing Services

You might want to restart a service only if it's already running and only on certain hosts.

```yaml
---
- name: Conditional service management
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
      when: "'webserver' in group_names and ansible_facts.services['nginx.service'].state == 'running'"
```

In this case, the `nginx` service is restarted only if the host is part of the `webserver` group and the service is currently running.

## Conclusion

Using conditionals in Ansible plays and playbooks allows for more dynamic and context-aware automation. By leveraging the power of conditionals, you can ensure that your tasks are executed in an intelligent manner, adapting to the environment and specific conditions of your hosts. This tutorial has demonstrated basic to advanced uses of conditionals, enabling you to control the execution flow of your Ansible tasks effectively. As you become more familiar with these concepts, you'll be able to write more complex and efficient playbooks tailored to your specific needs.
