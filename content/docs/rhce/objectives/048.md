# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible for Security

## Introduction

In the domain of system administration, particularly under the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) curriculum, security stands as a pivotal focus area. Automation of security-related tasks not only boosts efficiency but also ensures consistent application of security measures across various environments. Ansible, an open-source automation tool, excels in this area by simplifying complex configuration, deployment, and orchestration tasks. This tutorial will guide you through automating standard RHCSA security tasks using Ansible, ensuring your systems are secure and compliant with minimal manual effort.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the automation scripts, ensure you have the following setup:
- **Ansible installed** on your control node (the machine from which you will run the Ansible commands).
- **Managed nodes** (your target servers) accessible via SSH from the control node.
- **Sudo privileges** on the managed nodes for the user under which Ansible commands will be executed.

### 1. Setting up Your Inventory

Ansible works by interacting with a list of nodes defined in an inventory file. Here is a simple example of setting up an inventory file:

```ini
[webservers]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
webserver2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[dbservers]
dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.201
```

### 2. Automating User Account Security

One of the common security tasks is ensuring that only the required user accounts exist on the system and have the correct privileges.

#### Example Playbook: Managing User Accounts

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure security for user accounts
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Remove unauthorized user
      user:
        name: unauthorized_user
        state: absent

    - name: Add authorized user
      user:
        name: authorized_user
        password: "{{ 'secure_password' | password_hash('sha512') }}"
        state: present

    - name: Ensure user is in required group
      user:
        name: authorized_user
        groups: admin
        append: yes
```

### 3. Managing Firewalls with Ansible

Ensuring that the firewall is configured correctly is a critical part of securing a system.

#### Example Playbook: Configuring Firewall Rules

```yaml
---
- name: Configure system firewall
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install firewalld
      yum:
        name: firewalld
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable firewalld
      service:
        name: firewalld
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Add firewall rule
      firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes
```

### 4. Enforcing Password Policies

Password policies are crucial for maintaining system security. Ansible can help ensure that password policies meet the organization's standards.

#### Example Playbook: Setting Password Policies

```yaml
---
- name: Enforce password quality standards
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install password quality checking library
      yum:
        name: libpwquality
        state: present

    - name: Update password-auth
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/security/pwquality.conf
        regexp: '^minlen'
        line: 'minlen = 12'
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to automate a range of security-related tasks using Ansible, including user management, firewall configurations, and password policies. By integrating these automation scripts into your routine, you can enhance the security posture of your environment with consistent and error-free implementations. Automation not only saves time but also significantly reduces the possibility of human error, making it an indispensable tool in the arsenal of any system administrator, especially within the scope of RHCSA security tasks. Use this guide as a stepping stone to further explore and expand your automation capabilities with Ansible.
