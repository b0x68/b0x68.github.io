# Tech Tutorial: Be able to perform all tasks expected of a Red Hat Certified System Administrator

## Exam Objective: Create and Configure File Systems

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create and configure file systems on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system, an essential skill for any Red Hat Certified System Administrator. Managing file systems involves creating, mounting, unmounting, and configuring storage devices to keep data organized and accessible. We'll cover various file system types supported by RHEL, such as ext4, XFS, and Btrfs, and demonstrate how to handle them using real-world scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### **1. Identifying Current File Systems**

Before creating new file systems, it's important to know what is currently available on your system.

**Command:**
```bash
lsblk
```
This command lists all block devices attached to the system, showing whether or not they have file systems associated with them.

#### **2. Creating a New Partition**

To create a new file system, you first need a new partition. We'll use `fdisk` for creating a new partition.

**Example:**
Suppose `/dev/sdb` is a new, unpartitioned disk.

**Commands:**
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```
- Type `n` for new partition
- Choose `p` for primary
- Enter partition number (e.g., 1)
- Press Enter to accept default first and last sectors
- Type `w` to write the new partition table to disk

#### **3. Creating a File System**

After creating a partition, you can create a file system on it. We'll create an ext4 file system on the newly created partition `/dev/sdb1`.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```
This command formats the partition `/dev/sdb1` with the ext4 file system.

#### **4. Mounting the File System**

To use the newly created file system, you need to mount it.

**Commands:**
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk
```
This mounts the partition `/dev/sdb1` to the directory `/mnt/newdisk`.

#### **5. Automatically Mounting at Boot**

To ensure the file system is mounted every time the system boots, you need to edit the `/etc/fstab` file.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
**Add the following line:**
```plaintext
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk ext4 defaults 0 2
```
This ensures the system automatically mounts `/dev/sdb1` at `/mnt/newdisk` with default mount options.

#### **6. Checking the File System**

After mounting, you can check the file system for errors.

**Command:**
```bash
sudo fsck /dev/sdb1
```
This checks the integrity of the file system on `/dev/sdb1`.

### Detailed Code Examples

**Creating a XFS File System:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create a partition (assuming /dev/sdc is the target disk)
sudo fdisk /dev/sdc

# Step 2: Create an XFS file system
sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1

# Step 3: Mount the XFS file system
sudo mkdir /mnt/xfsdisk
sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/xfsdisk

# Step 4: Edit /etc/fstab for automatic mounting
echo '/dev/sdc1 /mnt/xfsdisk xfs defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to create and configure file systems on a RHEL system, an essential skill for system administrators. By understanding how to manage partitions, create various types of file systems, mount them, and ensure they remain accessible after rebooting, you're well on your way to mastering file system management in a Red Hat environment. Remember, practice is key, so experiment with different file system types and configurations to solidify your understanding.
