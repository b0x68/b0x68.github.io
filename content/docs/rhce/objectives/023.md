# Tech Tutorial: Use Roles and Ansible Content Collections

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the world of Ansible, a powerful automation tool used to configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Specifically, we'll focus on understanding how to utilize roles and Ansible Content Collections. These are essential components for structuring large projects, reusing code, and sharing content within the Ansible community or within your organization.

### What are Ansible Roles?

Roles in Ansible are a way of grouping related tasks, variables, files, and templates into a coherent group, making your Ansible code cleaner and more reusable. Think of roles as miniature Ansible projects with their own directory structure.

### What are Ansible Content Collections?

Introduced in Ansible 2.9, Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. Collections make it easier to package and share Ansible content across different servers or teams.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Ansible

Before we get started, you need to have Ansible installed on your system. If Ansible is not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

### Step 2: Find and Install an Ansible Collection

For this tutorial, let's use a popular collection from Ansible Galaxy, which is a repository of community-contributed Ansible content. We'll use the `nginxinc.nginx` collection as an example.

1. Search for the collection on Ansible Galaxy:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection search nginx
   ```

2. Install the collection:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy collection install nginxinc.nginx
   ```

### Step 3: Explore the Collection

After installing the collection, explore its contents. You can see the installed collections in `~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections`.

```bash
ls ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/nginxinc/nginx
```

You should find directories like `roles`, `plugins`, `modules`, etc.

### Step 4: Create a Playbook Using the Collection

Let's create a playbook that uses a role from the `nginxinc.nginx` collection to install and configure NGINX on a local server.

1. Create a new file named `nginx_setup.yml`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install and start NGINX
     hosts: localhost
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - include_role:
           name: nginxinc.nginx.nginx
   ```

2. Run the playbook:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook nginx_setup.yml
   ```

### Detailed Code Examples

Let's expand our playbook to configure NGINX with a virtual host.

1. Modify the `nginx_setup.yml`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install and configure NGINX
     hosts: localhost
     become: yes
     collections:
       - nginxinc.nginx
     tasks:
       - name: Include NGINX role from collection
         include_role:
           name: nginx
       - name: Setup a virtual host
         template:
           src: templates/vhost.conf.j2
           dest: /etc/nginx/conf.d/vhost.conf
   ```

2. Create a template file `templates/vhost.conf.j2`:

   ```nginx
   server {
     listen 80;
     server_name {{ ansible_hostname }};

     location / {
       root /usr/share/nginx/html;
       index index.html index.htm;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Run the playbook again:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook nginx_setup.yml
   ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to use Ansible roles and content collections to automate server configurations with ease. By utilizing roles and collections, you can leverage existing, tested, and reliable Ansible content, significantly speeding up your automation tasks and ensuring consistency across environments. Remember, the key to effective automation is not just using the right tools but also structuring and organizing your code in a way that promotes reuse and maintainability.
