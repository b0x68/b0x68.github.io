# Tech Tutorial: Configuring Local Storage for Red Hat Certified System Administrator

## Introduction

In the realm of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), mastering the configuration of local storage is crucial for system administrators. This skill is essential not only for day-to-day management but also a key objective of the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamental steps of configuring local storage, including creating and managing disk partitions, file systems, and logical volumes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

- A system running RHEL 8 (or a CentOS 8 as a free alternative).
- Root or sudo privileges.
- Basic understanding of the command line interface.

### Tools and Concepts

- **fdisk/gdisk**: Command-line utilities for disk partitioning.
- **parted**: A utility for adding and deleting partitions on storage devices.
- **LVM (Logical Volume Manager)**: Offers a more flexible approach to managing storage.
- **mkfs**: Used to create file systems on a partition.
- **mount**: Command to attach the file system to a directory.

### Step 1: List Existing Storage Devices

First, identify the storage devices attached to your system using the `lsblk` command:

```bash
lsblk
```

This command will list all block devices, along with their mount points and storage capacities.

### Step 2: Partitioning the Disk

Suppose `/dev/sdb` is the new hard drive we want to partition. We can use `fdisk` for MBR partition tables or `gdisk` for GPT.

#### Using fdisk:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```

- Type `n` to create a new partition.
- Choose `p` for primary.
- Enter partition number, start, and end sectors (or size, e.g., `+20G` for 20 GB).
- Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

#### Using gdisk for GPT:

```bash
sudo gdisk /dev/sdb
```

- Type `n` to add a new partition.
- Enter partition number and the start and end points.
- Type `w` to write the changes and exit.

### Step 3: Creating a File System

After creating a partition, e.g., `/dev/sdb1`, you can create a file system on it:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```

This formats the partition `/dev/sdb1` with the ext4 file system.

### Step 4: Mounting the File System

To use the newly created file system, mount it to a directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk
```

To ensure the disk is mounted automatically at boot, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:

```bash
echo '/dev/sdb1 /mnt/newdisk ext4 defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### Step 5: Managing Storage with LVM

For more advanced management, use LVM:

1. **Create Physical Volume:**
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
   ```
2. **Create Volume Group:**
   ```bash
   sudo vgcreate vg01 /dev/sdb1
   ```
3. **Create Logical Volume:**
   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -n lv01 -L 10G vg01
   ```
4. **Create File System on LV:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg01/lv01
   ```
5. **Mount Logical Volume:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/lvdisk
   sudo mount /dev/vg01/lv01 /mnt/lvdisk
   ```

## Detailed Code Examples

The above steps are critical for managing local storage. Each command line tool (`fdisk`, `gdisk`, `mkfs`, `mount`) plays a pivotal role, and their combined usage provides complete control over the storage lifecycle.

## Conclusion

Configuring local storage on RHEL systems is a foundational skill for system administrators. From partitioning disks to setting up file systems and configuring logical volumes with LVM, each step is crucial in managing system resources efficiently. By familiarizing yourself with these commands and utilities, you can ensure robust and flexible storage solutions tailored to specific needs, paving the way for successful system administration and preparation for the RHCSA exam.
