# Tech Tutorial: Configure Ansible Managed Nodes

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to delve into the process of converting simple shell scripts into Ansible playbooks. Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. By converting shell scripts into Ansible playbooks, we can leverage Ansible's idempotent and declarative nature, meaning that operations can be run multiple times without affecting the final state.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Ansible

Before converting shell scripts into Ansible playbooks, it's essential to understand some key concepts in Ansible:

- **Inventory**: Defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate.
- **Playbook**: A list of plays that describe automation jobs, and a play defines a set of activities (tasks) to be run on hosts.
- **Modules**: The units of code Ansible executes. Each module has a particular use, from dealing with system files to installing packages or making API calls.
- **Tasks**: The units of action in Ansible. Each task calls a single module, passing it specific options needed to complete a piece of work.

### Step 2: Analyze the Shell Script

Consider a simple shell script used to update and upgrade system packages on a Linux system:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Updating system packages..."
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
echo "System update complete."
```

### Step 3: Convert Shell Script to Ansible Playbook

1. **Create the Playbook File**: Start by creating a YAML file for the Ansible playbook (e.g., `update_system.yml`).

2. **Define Hosts and User**: Specify which hosts from your inventory this playbook will run on and define the remote user.

    ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Update and upgrade system packages
      hosts: all
      become: yes
      tasks:
    ```

3. **Convert Script Commands to Tasks**:
    - Use the `apt` module, which is specifically designed for package management with APT (used in Debian-based systems like Ubuntu).

    ```yaml
      tasks:
        - name: Update apt repo and cache
          apt:
            update_cache: yes
            cache_valid_time: 3600

        - name: Upgrade all packages
          apt:
            upgrade: dist
    ```

4. **Run the Playbook**: Use the `ansible-playbook` command to execute your playbook:

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook update_system.yml
    ```

### Detailed Code Examples

Here is the completed playbook `update_system.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Update and upgrade system packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo and cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600

    - name: Upgrade all packages
      apt:
        upgrade: dist
```

This playbook can be run on any number of hosts defined in your inventory, ensuring all are updated and upgraded in a uniform manner.

## Conclusion

Converting shell scripts into Ansible playbooks not only improves scalability and consistency but also enhances error handling and reduces manual oversight. Ansible's playbooks provide a clear, readable way to define what should happen on a server, making your automation efforts more maintainable and straightforward.

By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can start transforming your shell scripts into robust Ansible playbooks, leveraging the full power of automation for your infrastructure management tasks.
