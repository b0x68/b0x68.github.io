# Tech Tutorial: Configure Ansible Managed Nodes

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will focus on a crucial aspect of setting up Ansible for managing nodes in a network: creating and distributing SSH keys. SSH (Secure Shell) keys are an essential part of secure communication between the Ansible control machine and the managed nodes, allowing for passwordless authentication that is both secure and convenient.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- An Ansible control machine (Linux/Unix based)
- One or more managed nodes (Linux/Unix based)
- Sudo or root access on all machines
- SSH installed on all machines

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Generate SSH Keys on the Ansible Control Machine

First, you need to create a new SSH key pair on the Ansible control machine unless you already have one that you prefer to use.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ansible@controlmachine"
```

- `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key to create, here RSA.
- `-b 4096`: Specifies the key strength. 4096 bits is considered very secure.
- `-C`: A comment to identify the key. This can be anything, but it's useful to make it something descriptive.

Press `Enter` to accept the default file location and file name. When prompted, either set a passphrase for extra security or press `Enter` twice to skip and create the key without a passphrase.

### Step 2: Copy the Public Key to Managed Nodes

Now that you have generated an SSH key pair, the next step is to copy the public key to each managed node. Ansible provides an easy way to do this using the `ansible-copy` module, but first, let's use the `ssh-copy-id` utility for simplicity:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@managed_node_ip
```

Replace `user` with the username and `managed_node_ip` with the IP address of the managed node. This command will prompt you for the user's password on the managed node.

### Step 3: Verify SSH Key Authentication

To ensure that the SSH key was copied correctly and you can authenticate without a password, try logging into the managed node:

```bash
ssh user@managed_node_ip
```

If you are not prompted for a password, then the setup was successful.

### Step 4: Configure Ansible to Use SSH Keys

After setting up SSH keys, configure Ansible to use these keys when communicating with managed nodes. You can specify the private key file in the Ansible configuration file or use it directly in ad-hoc commands or playbooks:

```yaml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Here, `inventory.yml` is your inventory file, and `playbook.yml` is your playbook file.

## Detailed Code Example

Let's create a simple playbook to demonstrate using SSH keys with Ansible. The playbook will ping all nodes in the inventory to ensure they are reachable over SSH.

Create a file named `ping-test.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Test Connectivity
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping test
      ping:
```

Run this playbook with:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ping-test.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see output indicating success for each managed node.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to create SSH keys, distribute them to managed nodes, and configure Ansible to use these keys for secure, passwordless authentication. This setup not only enhances security but also streamlines the management process, making it easier to execute Ansible commands and playbooks across your infrastructure. Remember, managing SSH keys responsibly is crucial, so always keep your private keys secure and rotate them periodically.
