# Tech Tutorial: Understand Core Components of Ansible – Focusing on Facts

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration tasks and system administration. One of the essential features of Ansible is its ability to gather system-specific information called "facts," which can be used to execute tasks conditionally, set specific configurations, and ensure your automation is context-aware. This tutorial aims to provide an in-depth understanding of Ansible facts, how they are gathered, and how to use them effectively in your Ansible playbooks.

## What Are Ansible Facts?

Ansible facts are data structures containing information about the system, such as network interfaces, operating system, IP addresses, memory, disk space, and more. These facts are gathered by Ansible from the managed nodes using the setup module. They are automatically populated at the beginning of each playbook run and can be reused as variables throughout the playbook to make decisions based on the actual state of the system.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start, ensure you have Ansible installed on your control machine (the machine that manages others). You can install Ansible on a Linux system using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

You should also have at least one managed node (a server or machine managed by Ansible) that is reachable from the control machine.

### Step 2: Understanding How to Access Facts 

Create a simple playbook to print all facts about a managed node. Create a file named `list_facts.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Gather and display all facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Gather facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:

    - name: Print all gathered facts
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts
```

Run this playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts list_facts.yml
```

Here, `-i hosts` specifies the inventory file which lists the managed nodes.

### Step 3: Using Facts in Playbooks

You can use facts to make decisions in your playbooks. For instance, let’s create a playbook that installs a package only if the managed node is a Debian-based system.

Create a file named `conditional_install.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Conditional package install based on OS type
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx on Debian-based systems
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
```

This playbook checks the `os_family` fact and installs nginx only if the system is Debian-based.

### Step 4: Filtering Specific Facts

Sometimes, gathering all facts is overkill and can slow down your playbook. You can gather specific subsets of facts using the `gather_subset` option:

```yaml
---
- name: Gather only network-related facts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Gather network facts
      ansible.builtin.setup:
        gather_subset: network

    - name: Print network interfaces
      debug:
        var: ansible_facts['interfaces']
```

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example: Adjust configuration based on memory size

Suppose you want to configure a Java application’s heap size based on the server's total memory. You could use a playbook like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Java heap size
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Set heap size based on total memory
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/java/java.conf
        regexp: '^JAVA_OPTS='
        line: "JAVA_OPTS='-Xmx{{ (ansible_facts['memtotal_mb']|int * 0.5) | int }}M'"
```

This playbook modifies the Java configuration file to set the heap size to 50% of the system's total memory.

## Conclusion

Ansible facts are a powerful tool in your automation toolkit, allowing you to make data-driven decisions within your playbooks. By gathering and utilizing system-specific information, you can tailor your automation to the specific characteristics of each managed node, improving both the robustness and the efficacy of your automation tasks. Whether you’re managing a small group of servers or a large-scale infrastructure, understanding and using Ansible facts effectively can significantly enhance your automation efforts.
