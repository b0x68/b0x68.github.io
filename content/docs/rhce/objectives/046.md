# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible Modules for Archiving

## Introduction

In the realm of system administration, especially for those preparing for the RHCSA (Red Hat Certified System Administrator) exam, understanding how to efficiently manage file archiving and transfers is crucial. Archiving is not only important for saving space but also for organizing files and securing data. Ansible, a powerful IT automation tool, simplifies these tasks with its easy-to-use modules. This tutorial will focus on using Ansible for automating archiving tasks which is a key competency in the RHCSA exam.

## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Its simplicity and versatility make it a popular choice for system administrators.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Linux commands and structures.
- Ansible installed on your machine. You can install Ansible on a Red Hat system using `sudo dnf install ansible`.
- Access to a Linux system where you can run Ansible playbooks.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, ensure that Ansible is installed and running on your system. You can check the version of Ansible with the following command:

```bash
ansible --version
```

Create a directory for your Ansible project and move into it:

```bash
mkdir ansible-archive-demo && cd ansible-archive-demo
```

Inside this directory, create a file named `hosts` that will contain information about the machines you want to automate:

```ini
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
```

### Step 2: Writing Your First Playbook for Archiving

Create a YAML file named `archive.yml`. This playbook will demonstrate how to compress and transfer a directory.

```yaml
---
- name: Archive task example
  hosts: local
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the archive directory exists
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/archive/
        state: directory

    - name: Copy files to archive directory
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: "{{ item }}"
        dest: "/tmp/archive/"
        mode: '0644'
      loop:
        - /etc/hosts
        - /etc/hostname

    - name: Archive the directory
      ansible.builtin.archive:
        path: /tmp/archive/
        dest: /tmp/archive.tar.gz
        format: gz
```

### Step 3: Running the Playbook

Run the playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts archive.yml
```

This command tells Ansible to run the `archive.yml` playbook with the inventory file `hosts`.

### Step 4: Verify the Archive

Check that the archive has been created and contains the expected files:

```bash
tar -tvf /tmp/archive.tar.gz
```

## Detailed Code Examples

In the playbook `archive.yml`, we used several modules:

- **ansible.builtin.file**: Ensures that a directory exists. If the directory does not exist, it creates it.
- **ansible.builtin.copy**: Copies files from the local machine to a specified destination. We used a loop to copy multiple files.
- **ansible.builtin.archive**: Compresses and bundles the specified files into an archive. We specified `gz` as the format to use gzip compression.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to automate the archiving of files using Ansible, which is a practical skill for the RHCSA exam and real-world system administration. Automating these tasks can save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistency in how data is backed up and managed across systems. Ansible provides a straightforward and effective way to manage such tasks, making it a valuable tool in any system administrator's toolkit.
