# Tech Tutorial: Install and Configure an Ansible Control Node

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that is used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses a simple syntax written in YAML called playbooks. Ansible is agentless, meaning that it does not require any software to be installed on the nodes it manages. Instead, it uses SSH to communicate with the nodes.

One of the first steps in using Ansible is setting up a control node and creating a static host inventory file. This tutorial will guide you through installing Ansible on a control node, creating a static host inventory file, and testing the setup with a basic command.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need the following:
- A Linux-based system (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, etc.) for the control node.
- Python installed on the control node (Python 2.7 or Python 3.5 and higher).
- One or more managed nodes (these can be any server or device with SSH access and Python installed).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install Ansible

**On Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

**On CentOS:**
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible
```

**On Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install ansible
```

### Step 2: Verify Ansible Installation

Run the following command to check the Ansible version. This also confirms that Ansible is installed properly.
```bash
ansible --version
```

### Step 3: Create the Inventory File

Ansible uses an inventory file to track which servers it can communicate with. Here, we'll create a basic static inventory file.

1. Create a directory for your Ansible configurations and inventory:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ansible
   cd ~/ansible
   ```

2. Create an inventory file named `hosts`:
   ```bash
   touch hosts
   ```

3. Open the file with a text editor:
   ```bash
   nano hosts
   ```

4. Add the following contents to the `hosts` file:
   ```ini
   [webservers]
   webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key

   [dbservers]
   dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.102 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
   ```

   In this example:
   - `webservers` and `dbservers` are groups of servers.
   - `webserver1` and `dbserver1` are the aliases for the actual servers.
   - `ansible_host` defines the IP address of the server.
   - `ansible_user` specifies the user to log in as.
   - `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` points to the SSH key for passwordless authentication.

5. Save and close the file.

### Step 4: Test the Inventory

Now, letâ€™s test if Ansible can connect to the servers listed in your inventory file.

```bash
ansible all -m ping -i ~/ansible/hosts
```

This command will attempt to ping all the hosts in your inventory. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a success message for each host.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Ansible on a control node, created a static host inventory file, and tested your setup. This foundational step sets the stage for more complex Ansible operations, such as running playbooks to automate tasks across multiple servers. As you expand your Ansible skills, you can start to explore dynamic inventories, roles, and modules to harness the full power of Ansible for automation.
