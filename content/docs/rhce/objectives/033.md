# Tech Tutorial: Run Playbooks with Automation Content Navigator

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to utilize the Automation Content Navigator to enhance your Ansible playbooks by discovering and integrating new modules from available Ansible Content Collections. The Automation Content Navigator is a powerful tool designed to help users navigate through the vast landscape of modules, plugins, and roles provided by the Ansible community and other sources.

Ansible Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content that can include playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins. These collections can be used to package and distribute automation content, making it easier to share and implement across different projects and environments.

## Pre-requisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following set up in your environment:
- Ansible installed (version 2.9 or later)
- Access to Automation Content Navigator
- Internet connectivity to download collections from Ansible Galaxy or other repositories

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accessing Automation Content Navigator

First, access the Automation Content Navigator through your Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform or via its web interface if available. This tool is typically integrated into the Ansible Automation Platform, providing a graphical interface to explore available collections.

### Step 2: Searching for Collections

Use the search bar or browse through categories to find collections relevant to your project. For instance, if you are looking for modules that manage network devices, you might search for "network automation".

### Step 3: Exploring Collections

Once you find a collection of interest, click on it to view details. Here you will find documentation, a list of included content (like modules and roles), and installation instructions. For this tutorial, let's assume you are interested in the `cisco.ios` collection which provides modules for managing Cisco IOS devices.

### Step 4: Installing Collections

To install the `cisco.ios` collection, run the following command in your CLI:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios
```

This command downloads and installs the collection from Ansible Galaxy into your Ansible environment.

### Step 5: Using Modules from the Collection

After installation, you can start using modules from the collection in your playbook. Hereâ€™s a simple example where we use the `ios_facts` module from the `cisco.ios` collection to gather facts from a Cisco IOS device:

```yaml
---
- name: Gather Cisco IOS device facts
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Collect facts from Cisco devices
      cisco.ios.ios_facts:
        gather_subset: all
```

### Step 6: Running the Playbook

Save the above playbook as `gather_ios_facts.yml` and run it using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook gather_ios_facts.yml -i inventory.ini
```

Replace `inventory.ini` with your inventory file that lists the Cisco IOS devices you want to target.

## Detailed Code Examples

Here is another example of using a module from the `cisco.ios` collection to configure an interface on a Cisco IOS device:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure interface on Cisco IOS devices
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: no

  tasks:
    - name: Set interface configuration
      cisco.ios.ios_interfaces:
        config:
          - name: GigabitEthernet0/1
            description: 'Uplink Interface'
            enabled: true
            duplex: auto
            speed: auto
```

This playbook will configure the `GigabitEthernet0/1` interface with specified settings on all devices listed under the `routers` group in your inventory.

## Conclusion

The Automation Content Navigator is an essential tool for discovering and utilizing new Ansible modules and other content efficiently. By integrating collections into your automation strategies, you enhance the capabilities of your playbooks and adapt quickly to new requirements or technologies. Explore various collections and experiment with their modules to fully leverage the power of Ansible in your automation tasks.

Happy Automating!
