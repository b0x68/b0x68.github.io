# Tech Tutorial: Managing Users and Groups as a Red Hat Certified System Administrator

## Introduction

In the realm of system administration, particularly on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), managing users and groups is a foundational skill. This tutorial will guide you through the essential tasks related to user and group management, aligning with the objectives set for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam. Whether you are preparing for the exam or looking to brush up on your system administration skills, this guide will provide you with practical, hands-on examples to efficiently manage users and groups on a Linux system.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Users and Groups

Before diving into the commands and procedures, it's crucial to understand the purpose and structure of users and groups in Linux:
- **Users** are accounts used for running processes and owning files. They can be either system users (for running services) or regular users (for human users).
- **Groups** are collections of users, which simplify the permissions management by allowing group-based access rights over system resources.

### 2. Managing Users

#### Creating a New User
To create a new user, use the `useradd` command. Here’s how to add a user named `john`:

```bash
sudo useradd john
```

To create a user with a home directory and specify the bash shell as the default, use:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash john
```

#### Setting or Changing a User’s Password

After creating a user, set the user's password with the `passwd` command:

```bash
sudo passwd john
```

You will be prompted to enter the password twice.

#### Deleting a User

To delete a user, use the `userdel` command. To remove the user along with their home directory, use:

```bash
sudo userdel -r john
```

### 3. Managing Groups

#### Creating a New Group

To create a new group named `developers`:

```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

#### Adding a User to a Group

To add the user `john` to the `developers` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG developers john
```

#### Removing a User from a Group

You can remove a user from a group by editing the `/etc/group` file manually or using `gpasswd`:

```bash
sudo gpasswd -d john developers
```

#### Deleting a Group

To delete a group:

```bash
sudo groupdel developers
```

### 4. Viewing User and Group Information

#### Listing All Users

To list all users on the system, you can look at the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```

#### Listing All Groups

Similarly, to list all groups, you can use:

```bash
cat /etc/group
```

#### Getting Information About a Specific User

To get detailed information about a user, use the `id` command:

```bash
id john
```

## Detailed Code Examples

Here’s a detailed example that combines the commands into a workflow for setting up a new project team in your system:

```bash
# Create a new group for the project
sudo groupadd projectx

# Create new users and add them to the group
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G projectx alice
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G projectx bob

# Set passwords for new users
sudo passwd alice
sudo passwd bob

# Verify that users are created and belong to the right group
id alice
id bob
```

## Conclusion

Managing users and groups is a critical task for system administrators. This tutorial covered how to create, modify, and delete users and groups in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is essential for securing and organizing users' access to system resources. By mastering these commands and procedures, you can ensure that your systems are both functional and secure, adhering to best practices in system administration.
