# Tech Tutorial: Create Ansible Plays and Playbooks

## Exam Objective: Configure Error Handling

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to configure error handling in Ansible plays and playbooks. Error handling is crucial in automation to ensure that your tasks can fail gracefully, and you can handle exceptions according to your operational needs. We will cover different strategies provided by Ansible, including the use of `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, `rescue`, and `always` blocks in a playbook.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Basic Error Ignoring with `ignore_errors`

The simplest form of error handling in Ansible is to use the `ignore_errors` directive. This directive tells Ansible to continue running the playbook even if a task fails.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
- name: Example of ignore_errors
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Attempt to read a non-existent file
      ansible.builtin.command: cat /nonexistentfile.txt
      ignore_errors: yes
```

In this example, Ansible attempts to read a file that does not exist. Normally, this would cause the playbook to fail. However, by setting `ignore_errors: yes`, the playbook will continue even if the task fails.

#### 2. Conditional Failure with `failed_when`

Sometimes you might want to fail a task based on specific conditions rather than an outright command failure. The `failed_when` directive allows you to define custom conditions under which a task should be considered failed.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
- name: Example of failed_when
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check disk space
      ansible.builtin.shell: df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}'
      register: disk_space
      failed_when: "'100%' in disk_space.stdout"
```

Here, the task checks the disk space usage on the root partition. We register the output and specify a `failed_when` condition to fail the task if the disk space reaches 100%.

#### 3. Using Blocks for Error Handling

Blocks introduce the ability to group tasks and handle errors more efficiently. A block can contain `rescue` and `always` sections to specify tasks that should run when the block either fails or completes.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
- name: Advanced error handling with blocks
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - block:
        - name: Try to access a database
          ansible.builtin.command: /usr/bin/access_db
      rescue:
        - name: Run if the block fails
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "Database access failed, running rescue tasks."
      always:
        - name: This runs regardless of block success
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "This task runs no matter what"
```

In this playbook, if the "Try to access a database" task fails, the tasks under `rescue` will execute. The `always` block contains tasks that will run regardless of the success or failure of the block.

### Detailed Code Examples

Here are additional detailed examples incorporating more complex error handling scenarios.

**Complex Block Handling:**

```yaml
---
- name: Complex block handling
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - block:
        - name: Task that might fail
          ansible.builtin.shell: might_fail_command
          register: result
        - name: Task that uses the result of the previous task
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "Result was {{ result.stdout }}"
      rescue:
        - name: Handle failure
          ansible.builtin.mail:
            to: admin@example.com
            subject: "Task Failure"
            body: "A task failed, please check."
      always:
        - name: Always execute this
          ansible.builtin.debug:
            msg: "End of block execution."
```

### Conclusion

Error handling in Ansible is a powerful feature that helps maintain the robustness of your automation scripts. By using `ignore_errors`, `failed_when`, and block structures (`rescue` and `always`), you can gracefully handle failures and ensure that necessary cleanup or alternative actions are performed. This enhances the reliability and maintainability of your Ansible playbooks. Use these strategies to build more resilient automation routines that can cope with unexpected situations effectively.
