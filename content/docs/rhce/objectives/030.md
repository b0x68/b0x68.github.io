# Tech Tutorial: Configure Ansible Managed Nodes

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful configuration management and orchestration tool that simplifies the process of automating IT tasks. One common task is deploying files across multiple systems, known as managed nodes. This tutorial will guide you through setting up your environment and deploying files to managed nodes using Ansible. By the end of this guide, you will understand how to use Ansible to ensure your configurations or scripts are consistently deployed across your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Ansible installed on a control machine (the system that will manage other nodes). For installation instructions, refer to the [official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).
- One or more managed nodes with SSH access enabled.
- The control machine should have SSH keys set up for accessing the managed nodes without a password.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Inventory

First, you need to define your managed nodes in an inventory file. This file will list all the hosts you want to manage with Ansible.

1. Create an inventory file named `hosts` in your working directory:
   ```bash
   nano hosts
   ```
2. Add the managed nodes under a group. For example:
   ```ini
   [servers]
   server1.example.com
   server2.example.com
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Playbook

A playbook is a YAML file where you define what you want to do on your managed nodes. Here, you will write a playbook to deploy files.

1. Create a playbook file named `deploy_files.yml`:
   ```bash
   nano deploy_files.yml
   ```

2. Add the following content to the playbook:
   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Deploy Files to Managed Nodes
     hosts: servers
     become: yes  # Use sudo
     tasks:
       - name: Copy file to managed node
         copy:
           src: /path/to/local/source_file.txt
           dest: /path/to/remote/destination_file.txt
           owner: root
           group: root
           mode: '0644'
   ```

   In this playbook:
   - `hosts: servers` targets the group defined in your inventory.
   - `become: yes` escalates privileges (equivalent to sudo).
   - The `copy` module copies a file from the local machine to the managed nodes.

### Step 3: Run the Playbook

Execute the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy_files.yml
```

This command tells Ansible to use the `hosts` inventory file and execute the `deploy_files.yml` playbook.

## Detailed Code Examples

Here's a more complex example that includes conditional file deployment and handling multiple files:

```yaml
---
- name: Advanced File Deployment
  hosts: servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Check if a file exists
      stat:
        path: /path/on/remote/server/config_file
      register: stat_result

    - name: Copy configuration file if not existing
      copy:
        src: ./files/config_file
        dest: /path/on/remote/server/config_file
        mode: '0644'
      when: not stat_result.stat.exists

    - name: Deploy multiple files
      with_fileglob:
        - "files/*"
      copy:
        src: "{{ item }}"
        dest: "/path/on/remote/server/{{ item | basename }}"
        mode: '0644'
```

In this playbook:
- The `stat` module checks for the existence of a file.
- The `when` clause conditionally executes a task.
- `with_fileglob` iterates over multiple files.

## Conclusion

Deploying files to managed nodes using Ansible is an efficient way to handle configurations across an infrastructure. By utilizing playbooks, you can automate complex tasks and ensure consistency in your environment. Practice using different modules and explore Ansible's powerful features to enhance your automation strategies further. As you grow more comfortable with Ansible, you'll find it an indispensable tool in your DevOps toolkit.
