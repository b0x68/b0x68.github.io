# Tech Tutorial: Create Ansible Plays and Playbooks

## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that is used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and more. It uses a simple syntax written in YAML, called playbooks, to describe automation jobs. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating Ansible plays and playbooks to configure systems to a specified state. We will cover basic concepts, write detailed playbook examples, and demonstrate how to execute these playbooks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:
- Ansible installed on your control machine (the machine where Ansible scripts are executed).
- One or more managed nodes (servers) where you have SSH access from the control machine.
- Python installed on the managed nodes, as Ansible uses Python for its modules.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Inventory File

First, you need an inventory file where Ansible can find the information about the systems you want to manage. Create a file named `hosts` in your working directory and add the following:

```ini
[webservers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[dbservers]
dbserver.example.com
```

### Step 2: Writing Your First Playbook

Create a file named `site.yml`. This will be your playbook where you define tasks to be executed on the managed nodes.

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure Apache is at the latest version and running
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest

    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

This playbook has one play that targets hosts under `webservers` group. It ensures Apache is installed (at the latest version) and running.

### Step 3: Execute the Playbook

Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

### Detailed Code Examples

#### Example 1: Configure Users

Suppose you want to ensure a specific set of users is present on all servers. Hereâ€™s how you could write that playbook (`users.yml`):

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure users are present on all servers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure user 'john' is present
      user:
        name: john
        state: present
        shell: /bin/bash

    - name: Ensure user 'jane' is present
      user:
        name: jane
        state: present
        shell: /bin/bash
```

#### Example 2: Secure SSH Configuration

This playbook (`secure_ssh.yml`) ensures that SSH is configured to deny root logins and only allow key-based authentication:

```yaml
---
- name: Secure SSH configuration
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Deny root SSH login
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present

    - name: Set SSH to allow only key-based authentication
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PasswordAuthentication'
        line: 'PasswordAuthentication no'
        state: present

    - name: Restart SSH
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to create Ansible plays and playbooks to configure systems to a specified state. We covered how to set up an inventory file, write simple playbooks for common system configuration tasks, and execute these playbooks. By mastering these basics, you are now equipped to extend your playbooks to handle more complex scenarios tailored to your environment.

Feel free to experiment with different modules and options available in Ansible to build more sophisticated automation scripts that can significantly streamline your operations.
