# Tech Tutorial: Create Ansible Plays and Playbooks

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration tasks and repetitive jobs. It is widely used for application deployment, configuration management, and continuous delivery. This tutorial will focus on creating Ansible plays and playbooks, which are essential components when automating tasks with Ansible. We will also explore some commonly used Ansible modules to give you a practical understanding of how to apply these concepts in real-world scenarios.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin writing plays and playbooks, you need to have Ansible installed on your control machine. Here's a quick setup:

- **Install Ansible:** On a Unix-like system, you can install Ansible with `pip`:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  pip3 install ansible
  ```

- **Verify Installation:** Check that Ansible is installed correctly:

  ```bash
  ansible --version
  ```

- **Setup Inventory:** Create an inventory file named `hosts` in your working directory:

  ```ini
  [web]
  192.168.1.101

  [db]
  192.168.1.102
  ```

### Step 2: Creating Your First Play

A play is a set of tasks that are executed on a group of hosts. Here’s a simple example of a play:

1. **Create a file named `first_play.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Ensure Apache is installed and running
     hosts: web
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Start Apache service
         service:
           name: apache2
           state: started
           enabled: yes
   ```

   This play consists of two tasks: installing Apache and ensuring that it is running.

### Step 3: Creating a Playbook

A playbook is a collection of plays. Let’s expand our previous example into a playbook with multiple plays.

1. **Create a file named `site.yml`:**

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Configure Web Server
     hosts: web
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install Apache
         apt:
           name: apache2
           state: present

       - name: Copy custom index.html
         copy:
           src: /path/to/index.html
           dest: /var/www/html/index.html

   - name: Configure Database Server
     hosts: db
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install MySQL
         apt:
           name: mysql-server
           state: present

       - name: Start MySQL service
         service:
           name: mysql
           state: started
           enabled: yes
   ```

   This playbook contains two plays: one for setting up a web server and another for a database server.

### Step 4: Running Your Playbook

To run the playbook, use the `ansible-playbook` command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml
```

This command specifies the inventory file `hosts` and the playbook `site.yml`.

## Detailed Code Examples

Here, we delve deeper into some commonly used modules:

- **`apt` Module:** Manages packages using the apt package manager (Debian/Ubuntu).

  ```yaml
  - name: Install git
    apt:
      name: git
      state: latest
  ```

- **`copy` Module:** Copies files from the local or remote machine to a location on the remote machine.

  ```yaml
  - name: Copy configuration file
    copy:
      src: /path/to/local/config.conf
      dest: /etc/config.conf
      owner: root
      group: root
      mode: '0644'
  ```

- **`service` Module:** Manages services on remote hosts.

  ```yaml
  - name: Ensure nginx is running
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
      enabled: yes
  ```

## Conclusion

Creating Ansible plays and playbooks is a fundamental skill for automating tasks across multiple servers. By using common modules such as `apt`, `copy`, and `service`, you can manage packages, copy files, and control services efficiently. With the examples and steps provided in this tutorial, you should now feel confident to write your own Ansible plays and playbooks to automate your environment. Remember, practice is key to mastering Ansible automation. Happy automating!
