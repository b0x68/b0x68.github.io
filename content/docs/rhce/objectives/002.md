# Tech Tutorial: Operate Running Systems as a Red Hat Certified System Administrator

## Introduction

Operating running systems efficiently is crucial for maintaining the stability, security, and performance of Linux servers. In this tutorial, we will delve into several key tasks that every Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) should master under the exam objective of "Operate running systems." This includes starting, stopping, and checking the status of network services, managing processes, scheduling tasks, and updating software packages.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Managing System Services with `systemctl`

System services in Red Hat Enterprise Linux are managed by `systemd`, and the primary command-line tool used to interact with `systemd` is `systemctl`.

#### Starting, Stopping, and Checking the Status of Services

- **Start a Service**: To start a service, for example `httpd` (Apache web server), you would use:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    ```

- **Stop a Service**: To stop the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop httpd
    ```

- **Check the Status of a Service**: To check the status:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status httpd
    ```
    This command provides detailed information about the service including whether it is currently running, its start time, and recent log entries.

#### Enabling and Disabling Services

- **Enable a Service**: To make sure a service starts on boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    ```

- **Disable a Service**: To prevent the service from starting on boot:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl disable httpd
    ```

### 2. Managing Processes

Understanding and managing processes is a fundamental task for system administrators.

#### Viewing Active Processes

- **List Active Processes**: You can use `ps` or `top`:
    ```bash
    ps aux
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    top
    ```

#### Killing Processes

- **Kill a Process**: If a process is not responding, you can terminate it using its PID:
    ```bash
    kill 1234
    ```
    or, to forcefully kill it:
    ```bash
    kill -9 1234
    ```

### 3. Scheduling Tasks with `cron`

`cron` is used to schedule commands at a specific time.

#### Creating a Cron Job

- **Edit Cron Jobs**:
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    Add a line to schedule a backup script to run daily at midnight:
    ```
    0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh
    ```

### 4. Updating Software Packages

Using `yum` or `dnf` to install, update, and remove packages is essential for maintaining system security and functionality.

#### Updating All Packages

- **Update System**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf update
    ```

#### Installing a Specific Package

- **Install a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install httpd
    ```

#### Removing a Package

- **Remove a Package**:
    ```bash
    sudo dnf remove httpd
    ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered essential tasks related to operating running systems as outlined in the Red Hat Certified System Administrator exam objectives. Mastery of `systemctl` for service management, process handling, task scheduling with `cron`, and package management with `dnf` are foundational skills that will aid any system administrator in effectively managing a Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment. Regular practice and exploration of these commands and tools are recommended to build proficiency and confidence.
