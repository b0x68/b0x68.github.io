# Tech Tutorial: Be Able to Perform All Tasks Expected of a Red Hat Certified System Administrator

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the core responsibilities of a Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA), focusing on how to deploy, configure, and maintain systems. These tasks are crucial for ensuring the effective operation of servers and systems within a business environment. By mastering these skills, you'll be able to set up, manage, and troubleshoot Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) environments proficiently.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Deploying Systems

Deploying systems typically involves the installation and initial setup of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We'll go through a basic server deployment.

#### Prerequisites
- A machine or virtual environment capable of installing RHEL.
- RHEL installation media or ISO file.

#### Installation Process
1. **Boot from the Installation Media:**
   - Insert the installation media (DVD, USB drive) into your server or configure your VM to boot from the ISO file.
   - Restart the machine and select the option to boot from the media.

2. **Select Installation Language and Region:**
   ```plaintext
   Choose your preferred language and region settings from the menu options.
   ```

3. **Installation Summary Screen:**
   - **Software Selection:** Choose the "Server with GUI" for a full graphical interface or "Minimal Install" for a headless server.
   - **Installation Destination:** Select the disk where RHEL will be installed.
   - **Network & Hostname:** Enable and configure the network settings. Set a hostname.
   - **System Timezone:** Set the appropriate timezone.

4. **Begin Installation:**
   - Click on "Begin Installation".
   - Set the root password and create an initial user account while the installation progresses.

5. **Complete Installation:**
   - Once the installation completes, reboot the system.

   ```plaintext
   Reboot now or later from the installation summary screen.
   ```

### 2. Configuring Systems

After deploying RHEL, configuring the system to meet specific operational requirements is essential.

#### Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP)

1. **Install Chrony:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum install chrony
   ```

2. **Configure Chrony:**
   - Edit the `/etc/chrony.conf` file to add NTP servers:
     ```bash
     server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst
     server 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org iburst
     ```

3. **Enable and Start Chrony:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd
   ```

4. **Verify Chrony Synchronization:**
   ```bash
   chronyc tracking
   ```

#### Configure a Web Server (Apache)

1. **Install Apache:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum install httpd
   ```

2. **Configure Apache:**
   - Create a configuration file or modify `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` as needed.
   - For a basic setup, you can modify the `Listen` directive to change the port or add virtual hosts.

3. **Enable and Start Apache:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now httpd
   ```

4. **Verify Apache is Running:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status httpd
   ```

### 3. Maintaining Systems

Regular maintenance is key to ensuring that the system remains secure, efficient, and stable.

#### System Updates

1. **Check for updates:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum check-update
   ```

2. **Apply Updates:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum update
   ```

#### System Monitoring

- **Check System Load:**
  ```bash
  uptime
  ```

- **Monitor Active Processes:**
  ```bash
  top
  ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the fundamental tasks of deploying, configuring, and maintaining systems as expected from a Red Hat Certified System Administrator. By following these steps, you'll be able to set up a RHEL server, configure essential services, and perform routine maintenance to keep the system running smoothly. Remember, continuous learning and practice are essential to mastering system administration in a Red Hat environment.
