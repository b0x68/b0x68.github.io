# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible Modules for Task Scheduling

## Introduction

In system administration, particularly for those preparing for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam, task scheduling is a crucial skill. It involves automating tasks to run at specific times or intervals, which is essential for system maintenance, updates, backups, and more. Normally, task scheduling on Linux systems can be managed with cron jobs, but Ansible offers a more scalable and manageable approach, especially for environments with multiple servers.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Ansible, an open-source automation tool, to manage task scheduling. We'll cover the necessary Ansible modules and provide a step-by-step guide on how to automate task scheduling across multiple systems using Ansible playbooks.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of Linux system administration and the command line.
- Ansible installed on a control node (your workstation or a management server).
- One or more managed nodes (servers) with SSH access from the control node.
- `sudo` privileges on all managed nodes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Inventory

First, create an inventory file that lists the servers where tasks will be scheduled. This file is typically named `hosts` and is located in `/etc/ansible` by default, but you can create it anywhere on your control node.

```ini
[servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102
```

### Step 2: Writing the Ansible Playbook

Create a playbook named `schedule_tasks.yml`. This playbook will define the tasks to be scheduled on the servers.

```yaml
---
- name: Schedule tasks on servers
  hosts: servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the cron package is installed (Debian/Ubuntu)
      apt:
        name: cron
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Schedule a daily backup job
      cron:
        name: "Daily backup"
        minute: "0"
        hour: "2"
        job: "/usr/bin/backup_script.sh > /dev/null 2>&1"
```

### Detailed Code Examples

**1. Installing cron package:** 
The first task checks if the cron package is installed on Debian/Ubuntu systems. This uses the `apt` module, which is tailored for managing packages on Debian-based distributions.

**2. Adding a cron job:**
The `cron` module is used to manage cron jobs. In the example above, a daily backup job is scheduled to run at 2 AM every day. Adjust the `minute`, `hour`, and `job` parameters to fit the specific task you need to schedule.

### Step 3: Running the Playbook

Execute the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook schedule_tasks.yml
```

This command will apply the defined tasks across all servers listed in your `hosts` inventory file.

## Conclusion

Using Ansible to manage task scheduling on multiple systems can greatly simplify administrative tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability across your environment. With the `cron` module, you can easily manage all your cron jobs from a single playbook, reducing the risk of errors and omissions that might occur when managing each server individually.

By automating task scheduling with Ansible, system administrators can save time, increase efficiency, and focus on more strategic tasks. Whether you're preparing for the RHCSA exam or looking to enhance your system administration skills, mastering Ansible for task scheduling is a valuable asset.

For further learning, consider exploring other Ansible modules and playbooks to automate different aspects of system administration, such as user management, file handling, and software installation. Happy automating!
