# Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible for File Systems

## Introduction
In the realm of Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) tasks, managing file systems is a fundamental skill. As systems scale, manual management of file systems becomes impractical. Automation is key. Ansible, a powerful IT automation tool, can simplify, automate, and enhance the management of file systems. This tutorial will focus on automating typical file system tasks using Ansible, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy in system administration.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Ansible Installed**: Ensure Ansible is installed on your control node. You can install it using `sudo yum install ansible` on RHEL or CentOS.
- **Managed Nodes Setup**: Ensure you have one or more managed nodes configured in your `/etc/ansible/hosts` file.
- **SSH Keys Configured**: Ensure SSH keys are configured for seamless authentication between the control node and managed nodes.

### 1. Basic Setup
Before diving into file system tasks, verify that Ansible can communicate with your managed nodes. Create a simple Ansible playbook called `ping.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Test Connectivity
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping test
      ping:
```

Run the playbook with:
```bash
ansible-playbook ping.yml
```

### 2. Creating and Managing File Systems

#### Creating a File System
Let's start by creating a new file system. We'll assume a new disk `/dev/sdb` is available.

```yaml
- name: Create and Mount a File System
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create a partition
      community.general.parted:
        device: /dev/sdb
        number: 1
        state: present

    - name: Create a filesystem
      filesystem:
        fstype: ext4
        dev: /dev/sdb1

    - name: Create mount directory
      file:
        path: /mnt/data
        state: directory

    - name: Mount the filesystem
      mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        src: /dev/sdb1
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted
```

#### Automating Mounts at Boot
To ensure the file system mounts at boot, update the `/etc/fstab` file.

```yaml
- name: Ensure filesystem mounts on boot
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add mount to fstab
      mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        src: /dev/sdb1
        fstype: ext4
        opts: defaults
        state: present
        dump: 0
        passno: 2
```

### 3. Modifying File System Properties

#### Resizing a File System
If you need to resize a file system, ensure it's unmounted, resize the partition, then the file system, and remount it.

```yaml
- name: Resize a File System
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Unmount the filesystem
      mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        state: unmounted

    - name: Resize partition
      community.general.parted:
        device: /dev/sdb
        number: 1
        state: present
        resize: true
        size: 10G

    - name: Resize filesystem
      filesystem:
        fstype: ext4
        resizefs: yes
        dev: /dev/sdb1

    - name: Remount the filesystem
      mount:
        path: /mnt/data
        src: /dev/sdb1
        fstype: ext4
        state: mounted
```

## Conclusion
Automating file system tasks with Ansible not only simplifies the day-to-day operations of a system administrator but also greatly enhances the reliability and reproducibility of system setups across the infrastructure. By leveraging Ansible modules such as `filesystem`, `parted`, and `mount`, admins can handle complex file system operations with ease. As you integrate these tasks into larger playbooks, remember to test in a development environment before deploying to production to ensure everything behaves as expected. Automation, when done right, is a powerful tool in your arsenal.
