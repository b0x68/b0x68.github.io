# Tech Tutorial: Configure Ansible Managed Nodes

In this tutorial, we'll delve into how to configure privilege escalation on managed nodes using Ansible. Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration tasks and consistent IT automation. Managing privileges correctly is crucial for security and proper management of your systems. We'll cover how to set up your Ansible environment to handle privilege escalation effectively.

## Introduction

Privilege escalation in Ansible is a mechanism that allows you to execute tasks as an administrator or another user. This is especially important when you are managing systems that require higher privileges for certain operations. For instance, installing packages, editing protected files, or starting/stopping services often require administrative privileges.

Ansible handles privilege escalation using `become`, a directive that allows your playbooks to become another user temporarily. The default method is `sudo`, though other methods like `su`, `pbrun`, `pfexec`, `doas`, and `dzdo` are also supported.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:
- An Ansible control node (a machine from which you will run your commands).
- At least one managed node (a server managed by Ansible).
- SSH access from your control node to your managed node.
- Python installed on the managed node (Python 2.7 or Python 3.5+).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Configure Ansible Inventory

First, you need to define your managed nodes in your Ansible inventory. This can be done in the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file or any custom inventory file.

```ini
[webservers]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.56.101 ansible_user=admin
```

### Step 2: Set Up SSH Key Authentication

Ensure that SSH key-based authentication is set up between your control node and managed nodes for the user specified. This is crucial for running commands without manual password entry.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
ssh-copy-id admin@192.168.56.101
```

### Step 3: Testing Basic Connectivity

Test your connection using the `ansible` command:

```bash
ansible webservers -m ping
```

### Step 4: Configure Privilege Escalation

Edit your Ansible configuration file (`ansible.cfg`) to enable privilege escalation. The file could be in your project directory or the default `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.

```ini
[defaults]
become=True
become_method=sudo
become_user=root
become_ask_pass=False
```

### Step 5: Create a Playbook with Privilege Escalation

Create a YAML file for your playbook (`install_httpd.yml`) that installs the Apache server on a webserver which requires administrative privileges.

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache Web Server
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
```

### Step 6: Run the Playbook

Execute the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook install_httpd.yml
```

## Detailed Code Examples

Letâ€™s consider a more complex example where you need to edit a protected system file and restart a service.

```yaml
---
- name: Update sysctl.conf
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Increase file descriptor limit
      blockinfile:
        path: /etc/sysctl.conf
        block: |
          fs.file-max = 65536
    - name: Reload sysctl
      command: sysctl -p

    - name: Restart the web service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted
```

## Conclusion

Configuring privilege escalation correctly in Ansible is essential for performing administrative tasks on managed nodes securely and effectively. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can set up Ansible to manage any number of servers, ensuring that tasks requiring elevated privileges are handled smoothly. Remember, always test your configurations in a safe environment before deploying them to production.

By mastering privilege escalation in Ansible, you enhance your automation capabilities, making your infrastructure management both scalable and secure.
