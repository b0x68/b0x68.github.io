# Tech Tutorial: Understand Core Components of Ansible - Inventories

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration tasks and system management. A fundamental aspect of Ansible is its use of inventories. An inventory is essentially a list of nodes or hosts that Ansible manages. It defines where Ansible looks for the servers or devices it needs to configure. This tutorial will guide you through understanding and leveraging Ansible inventories effectively.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding the Basics of Ansible Inventory

An Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. The default location for an inventory file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`, but you can specify a different inventory file at the command line using the `-i` option.

### Step 2: Creating Your First Inventory

1. **Simple Inventory:**
   - Create a file named `inventory` and open it in a text editor.
   - Add the following content:
     ```ini
     [webserver]
     192.168.1.2
     192.168.1.3

     [database]
     dbserver.domain.com
     ```
   - Here, `webserver` and `database` are group names, which contain the respective hosts.

2. **Host Variables:**
   - You can also assign variables to hosts directly in the inventory file:
     ```ini
     [webserver]
     192.168.1.2 http_port=80 max_requests=1000
     192.168.1.3 http_port=80 max_requests=1000

     [database]
     dbserver.domain.com db_port=5432 db_name=mydatabase
     ```
   - These variables (`http_port`, `max_requests`, `db_port`, `db_name`) can be used in your playbooks.

### Step 3: Working with Dynamic Inventories

While static inventories are defined in a file, dynamic inventories allow Ansible to pull inventory from external sources. For example, you might use a script that pulls data from AWS EC2, or from a CMDB.

1. **Example Script:**
   - Hereâ€™s a simple Python script that generates a JSON output for dynamic inventory:
     ```python
     #!/usr/bin/env python
     import json

     inventory = {
         "webserver": {
             "hosts": ["192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3"],
             "vars": {
                 "http_port": 80,
                 "max_requests": 1000
             }
         },
         "database": {
             "hosts": ["dbserver.domain.com"],
             "vars": {
                 "db_port": 5432,
                 "db_name": "mydatabase"
             }
         }
     }

     print(json.dumps(inventory))
     ```
   - Make this script executable and use it as an inventory with Ansible commands:
     ```bash
     chmod +x dynamic_inventory.py
     ansible all -i ./dynamic_inventory.py -m ping
     ```

### Step 4: Ansible Inventory Parameters and Groups

1. **Group Variables:**
   - Define variables that are common to a group in your inventory file:
     ```ini
     [webserver:vars]
     http_port=80
     max_requests=1000
     ```
   - This sets `http_port` and `max_requests` for all hosts under the `webserver` group.

2. **Child Groups:**
   - You can define hierarchical relationships between groups:
     ```ini
     [datacenter1]
     host1
     host2

     [datacenter2]
     host3
     host4

     [all_webservers:children]
     datacenter1
     datacenter2
     ```
   - Here, `all_webservers` includes all hosts from `datacenter1` and `datacenter2`.

## Conclusion

Ansible inventories are a flexible and powerful way to manage groups of hosts. They allow you to apply configurations selectively and efficiently. Whether you use static or dynamic inventories, understanding how to manipulate and leverage these files can significantly enhance your Ansible projects. Practice creating and manipulating these files to better understand how Ansible interacts with different hosts and groups.
