# Tech Tutorial: Manage Content Persistency Across Reboots in Red Hat Systems

## Introduction

In Red Hat and other Linux-based systems, ensuring that your configurations persist after a reboot is crucial for maintaining system stability and reliability, especially in a production environment. This tutorial will guide you through the steps required to make sure that your system configurations are not lost upon reboot. We will cover common scenarios such as managing services, network configurations, and custom scripts.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Managing Systemd Services

**Systemd** is an init system used in many Linux distributions to bootstrap the user space and manage system processes after booting. It is essential to ensure that any critical service you configure is enabled to start on boot.

#### Example: Enabling and Starting a Web Server

Let's assume you are configuring an Apache web server.

**Step 1: Install Apache**

```bash
sudo yum install httpd
```

**Step 2: Start the Apache Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
```

**Step 3: Enable Apache Service on Boot**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable httpd
```

This command creates a symbolic link from the system's copy of the service file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service`) to the location systemd looks for auto-start files (`/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/`). This ensures that Apache starts on every boot.

### 2. Persisting Network Configurations

Network configurations can be managed through the `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/` directory where each network interface has a corresponding script.

#### Example: Setting a Static IP

**Step 1: Edit the Interface Configuration File**

For an interface named `eth0`, edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
```

**Add or modify the following lines:**

```plaintext
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
IPADDR=192.168.1.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
```

- `BOOTPROTO=none` - Disables DHCP.
- `ONBOOT=yes` - Ensures the interface is activated at boot.
- `IPADDR`, `NETMASK`, `GATEWAY` - Set static networking information.

**Step 2: Restart the Network Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart network
```

### 3. Managing Custom Scripts on Boot

For custom scripts that you might want to run at startup, you can use `cron` with the `@reboot` directive or create a new systemd service.

#### Example: Running a Script at Reboot with Cron

**Step 1: Create Your Script**

```bash
echo 'echo "Hello, World!" > /var/tmp/hello.txt' > /usr/local/bin/hello.sh
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hello.sh
```

**Step 2: Schedule the Script with Cron**

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot /usr/local/bin/hello.sh") | crontab -
```

#### Example: Creating a Systemd Service for a Script

**Step 1: Create a Service File**

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/myscript.service
```

**Add the following content:**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Script

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/hello.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Step 2: Enable and Start the Service**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable myscript
sudo systemctl start myscript
```

## Conclusion

Proper management of services, network configurations, and custom scripts with persistence across reboots is fundamental for server administration in Red Hat systems. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can ensure that your system configurations are maintained consistently, enhancing both stability and efficiency. Always remember to test configurations in a safe environment before applying them to production systems.
