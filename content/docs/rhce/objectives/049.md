# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible for Managing Users and Groups

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Ansible, a powerful automation tool, to manage users and groups on Linux systems, aligning with tasks commonly required for the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam. Ansible simplifies complex administrative tasks and ensures consistency and repeatability across multiple systems.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have the following:
- A working installation of Ansible on a control node (your workstation or a management server).
- One or more managed nodes (Linux servers) where SSH access is configured for the Ansible control node.
- `sudo` privileges on the managed nodes for the user Ansible will use.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Inventory

First, create or edit your Ansible inventory file (typically `hosts`), which includes the managed nodes.

```ini
[all_servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102
```

### Step 2: Writing the Ansible Playbook

Create a YAML file named `manage_users.yml`. This playbook will contain tasks to manage users and groups.

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Users and Groups
  hosts: all_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure group "webadmin" exists
      ansible.builtin.group:
        name: webadmin
        state: present

    - name: Create user "john"
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: john
        comment: "John Doe"
        uid: 1040
        group: webadmin
        createhome: yes
        state: present

    - name: Ensure user "jane" is removed
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: jane
        state: absent
```

### Detailed Code Examples

#### 1. Managing Groups

The `ansible.builtin.group` module manages groups on the target hosts.

```yaml
- name: Ensure group "webadmin" exists
  ansible.builtin.group:
    name: webadmin
    state: present
```

This task ensures that the group `webadmin` is present on the system. If it does not exist, Ansible will create it.

#### 2. Adding and Modifying Users

The `ansible.builtin.user` module is used to manage users.

```yaml
- name: Create user "john"
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: john
    comment: "John Doe"
    uid: 1040
    group: webadmin
    createhome: yes
    state: present
```

This task ensures user `john` is present with the specified properties. If `john` does not exist, he will be created with a home directory.

#### 3. Removing Users

To remove a user, set the `state` to `absent`.

```yaml
- name: Ensure user "jane" is removed
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: jane
    state: absent
```

This task ensures the user `jane` is removed from the system.

### Step 3: Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook manage_users.yml
```

## Conclusion

Using Ansible to manage users and groups provides a scalable and repeatable method suitable for any environment, from small setups to large enterprises. By automating these tasks, system administrators can ensure consistent configurations across multiple systems, reducing the potential for human error and increasing efficiency.

With the playbook examples provided, you are well on your way to automating basic user and group management tasks required for the RHCSA exam and beyond. Whether modifying this playbook for more complex environments or integrating it into larger automation workflows, Ansible offers the flexibility and power needed for effective systems administration.
