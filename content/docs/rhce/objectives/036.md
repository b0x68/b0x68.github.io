# Tech Tutorial: Create Ansible Plays and Playbooks

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and much more. One of the key features of Ansible is its use of plays and playbooks to define and manage system configuration. In this tutorial, we will focus on a specific aspect of Ansible playbooks: using variables to retrieve the results of running commands.

Understanding how to capture the output of commands and use it within your playbooks can significantly enhance your automation scripts, making them more dynamic and efficient.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Variables in Ansible

In Ansible, variables are used to store values that can be used in your playbooks. They can be defined in various places within Ansible, such as in inventory files, in playbook files, or dynamically during task execution.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment

Before we start writing our playbook, ensure that Ansible is installed on your control machine. You can install Ansible on most Linux distributions using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

### Step 3: Writing a Basic Playbook

Create a new file named `capture-output.yml`:

```yaml
---
- name: Capture command output example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Run a shell command
      shell: ls -l /etc
      register: command_output
```

In the above playbook, we have a single task that runs the `ls -l /etc` command on the remote hosts. The `register` keyword is used to capture the output of the command into the variable `command_output`.

### Step 4: Using the Captured Output

Now that we've captured the output, we can use it in subsequent tasks. Add another task to the playbook to display the captured output:

```yaml
    - name: Show command output
      debug:
        msg: "The command output was: {{ command_output.stdout }}"
```

The `debug` module is used here to print the output stored in `command_output.stdout`.

### Step 5: Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file capture-output.yml
```

Replace `inventory_file` with the path to your inventory file. This will execute the playbook on the hosts specified in the inventory.

## Detailed Code Example

Letâ€™s consider a more practical example where we capture the disk usage of the remote system and send an email alert if it exceeds a certain threshold. Update your playbook as follows:

```yaml
---
- name: Check disk space and send alert
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check disk usage
      shell: df -h / | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $5}'
      register: disk_usage

    - name: Check if disk usage is more than 80%
      fail:
        msg: "Disk space usage is above 80%!"
      when: disk_usage.stdout | replace('%', '') | int > 80
```

This playbook checks the disk usage of the root partition and fails the task if the usage is over 80%.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to capture the output of commands in Ansible playbooks using variables. This technique is incredibly useful for creating dynamic automation scripts that react based on the state of your systems. By mastering this approach, you can significantly enhance the capabilities of your Ansible playbooks, making your automation tasks more robust and intelligent.
