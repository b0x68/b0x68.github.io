# Tech Tutorial: Run Playbooks with Automation Content Navigator

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to run playbooks using the Automation Content Navigator. Automation Content Navigator is typically a part of more extensive automation frameworks, providing a user-friendly interface to manage and execute Ansible playbooks, scripts, and other automation content. The focus will be on using this navigator to execute Ansible playbooks efficiently, which are crucial for automating repetitive tasks in software deployment, system updates, and infrastructure configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:
- An environment where Automation Content Navigator is installed and configured.
- Access to Ansible playbooks that you want to run.
- Necessary permissions to execute playbooks in your environment.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Accessing the Automation Content Navigator

First, you need to log into the Automation Content Navigator. This can usually be done through a web interface provided by the automation tool your organization uses. Enter the URL into your browser and log in using your credentials.

```plaintext
URL: http://your-automation-navigator-address
Username: your-username
Password: your-password
```

### Step 2: Navigating to Playbooks

Once you're logged in, navigate to the section where playbooks are managed. This can vary depending on the specific software you are using, but it is generally found under sections like "Automation", "Playbooks", or "Scripts".

```markdown
1. Click on the `Automation` tab on the main menu.
2. Select `Playbooks` from the dropdown menu.
```

### Step 3: Selecting Your Playbook

In the playbooks section, you will see a list of all the available playbooks. These playbooks can be written for various tasks such as deploying software, updating systems, or configuring servers.

```markdown
- Browse through the list or use the search bar to find the playbook you want to run.
- Click on the playbook name to open its details.
```

### Step 4: Configuring Playbook Parameters

Before running the playbook, you might need to configure certain parameters. These parameters can include things like target server addresses, user credentials, or specific configuration values needed by the playbook.

```yaml
# Example of a simple playbook parameter configuration
- hosts: servers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  roles:
    - common
```

```markdown
- Enter the required parameter values in the provided fields.
- Save your configuration.
```

### Step 5: Executing the Playbook

Now you're ready to execute the playbook. There should be an option like "Run", "Execute", or "Start" near the configuration settings.

```markdown
- Click the `Run` button.
- Monitor the execution progress through the interface.
```

### Step 6: Monitoring and Logs

After initiating the playbook, monitor its execution to ensure it runs as expected. The Automation Content Navigator typically provides a console output or a logging section where you can see real-time logs and the status of the playbook execution.

```markdown
- Navigate to the `Logs` section to view detailed output.
- Check for any errors or warnings.
```

## Detailed Code Example

Letâ€™s consider a simple Ansible playbook that installs and starts Apache on a remote server. Here is how you might set it up and run it through the Automation Content Navigator:

```yaml
---
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install apache2
    apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
  - name: Ensure apache2 is running
    service:
      name: apache2
      state: started
```

**Running this in the Navigator:**

1. Upload this playbook into the navigator.
2. Set the target hosts under the parameters section.
3. Execute the playbook and monitor the output via the logs provided in the Navigator interface.

## Conclusion

Running playbooks through the Automation Content Navigator simplifies the management and execution of automation tasks. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively utilize this powerful tool to automate your infrastructure with precision and ease. Whether updating servers or deploying new applications, the navigator helps streamline these operations, making your workflow more efficient and error-free.
