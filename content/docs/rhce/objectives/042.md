# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible Modules for Firewall Rules

## Introduction
For system administrators managing Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) environments, automating repetitive tasks can drastically improve efficiency and reduce error rates. One common task that can be automated is the management of firewall rules. In this tutorial, we will explore how to use Ansible, a powerful automation tool, to manage firewall settings on a system that uses `firewalld`, which is a default firewall management tool on many Linux distributions including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites
Before beginning this tutorial, you will need:
- A basic understanding of Linux systems and the command line.
- One or more RHEL or CentOS systems to manage.
- Ansible installed on a control node (which can also be one of your RHEL/CentOS systems).
- `firewalld` installed and running on the managed nodes.

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Inventory
First, you need to set up your Ansible inventory. This is typically done in a file called `/etc/ansible/hosts`. Add your managed nodes under a group `[firewall_group]`:

```ini
[firewall_group]
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
```

### Step 2: Creating a Playbook
Create a new Ansible playbook named `firewall_rules.yml`. This playbook will contain the tasks needed to manage your firewall rules.

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Firewall Rules
  hosts: firewall_group
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Open HTTP port
      firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes

    - name: Allow ping
      firewalld:
        zone: public
        rich_rule: 'rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.0/24" icmp-type name="echo-request" accept'
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes
```

### Step 3: Running the Playbook
Run the playbook using the following command:
```bash
ansible-playbook firewall_rules.yml
```

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example 1: Opening a TCP Port
If you need to ensure a specific TCP port, say 8080, is open for your application, you can modify the playbook as follows:

```yaml
    - name: Open port 8080 for TCP traffic
      firewalld:
        port: 8080/tcp
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes
```

### Example 2: Blocking an IP Address
To block incoming traffic from a specific IP address, you can use a rich rule:

```yaml
    - name: Block IP address
      firewalld:
        rich_rule: 'rule family="ipv4" source address="203.0.113.1" drop'
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: yes
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, you've learned how to automate the management of firewall rules using Ansible. By using the `firewalld` module in Ansible, you can easily manage complex firewall settings across multiple systems, ensuring consistent security configurations and reducing manual configuration errors. Automation not only saves time but also enhances the security by ensuring consistency across your IT infrastructure. As you grow more comfortable with Ansible, consider exploring more of its modules to automate other aspects of your systems.
