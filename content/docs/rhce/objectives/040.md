# Tech Tutorial: Automate Standard RHCSA Tasks Using Ansible for Software Packages and Repositories

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into automating standard Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) tasks related to software packages and repositories using Ansible. Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration tasks and repetitive jobs. For RHCSA tasks, focusing on software packages and repositories means managing RPM packages and YUM repositories on Red Hat-based systems. We will cover the use of various Ansible modules like `yum`, `package`, and `yum_repository` to automate these tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A control node with Ansible installed. The control node could be your workstation or any system where you have installed Ansible.
- One or more managed nodes (CentOS, RHEL, Fedora) where you will automate RHCSA tasks. These nodes should be accessible from the control node via SSH.
- Proper network configuration and necessary permissions to manage the systems.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting Up Your Inventory

Create an inventory file (e.g., `hosts.ini`) that lists the managed nodes:

```ini
[all]
192.168.1.100 ansible_user=rhcsauser ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
192.168.1.101 ansible_user=rhcsauser ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
```

### Step 2: Managing RPM Packages

#### Installing a Package

Here is an example of an Ansible playbook (`install_httpd.yml`) that installs the `httpd` package using the `yum` module:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Apache HTTP Server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the httpd package is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
```

Run the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini install_httpd.yml
```

#### Removing a Package

To remove a package, you can modify the playbook to use `state: absent`. Here's how you can modify the above playbook to remove `httpd`:

```yaml
---
- name: Remove Apache HTTP Server
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the httpd package is removed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: absent
```

### Step 3: Managing YUM Repositories

#### Adding a Repository

You can automate the creation of YUM repositories using the `yum_repository` module. Hereâ€™s how you can add the EPEL repository:

```yaml
---
- name: Add EPEL Repository
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Add EPEL repo
      yum_repository:
        name: epel
        description: EPEL YUM repo
        baseurl: https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/$releasever/$basearch/
        enabled: yes
```

#### Removing a Repository

To remove a repository, set `state: absent` in the `yum_repository` module:

```yaml
---
- name: Remove EPEL Repository
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Remove EPEL repo
      yum_repository:
        name: epel
        state: absent
```

## Detailed Code Examples

For a real-world scenario, consider a situation where you need to ensure a group of web servers have Apache installed, and a specific repository is enabled for additional packages. You can combine the tasks from the above examples into a single playbook to handle both the installation of `httpd` and the configuration of a repository.

## Conclusion

Ansible provides a powerful framework for automating the management of software packages and repositories in a Red Hat environment, which is a crucial part of RHCSA tasks. By leveraging Ansible modules such as `yum` and `yum_repository`, system administrators can ensure consistency across multiple systems, reduce manual errors, and save time. As you have seen in this tutorial, setting up and using Ansible for these tasks is straightforward and can be adapted to fit specific needs in an enterprise environment.
