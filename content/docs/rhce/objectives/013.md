# Tech Tutorial: Understand Core Components of Ansible - Conditional Tasks

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies complex configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. In this tutorial, we will focus on an essential feature of Ansible: conditional tasks. Conditional tasks in Ansible allow you to execute tasks based on specified conditions, which is crucial for creating dynamic and flexible playbooks that adapt to different environments and scenarios.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Conditionals in Ansible

Ansible uses conditionals to control the execution flow of tasks. These are primarily handled with the `when` statement, which determines whether a task should be executed based on the evaluation of a condition.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into conditional tasks, ensure you have the following set up:
- **Ansible installed:** Ensure Ansible is installed on your control machine. You can install Ansible on a Linux system using `sudo apt-get install ansible` for Ubuntu or `sudo yum install ansible` for CentOS.
- **Inventory file configured:** This file contains information about the hosts you are managing through Ansible.
- **A basic playbook:** This is where you will define your tasks and conditionals.

### Step 3: Writing Conditional Tasks

Let’s create a simple playbook that demonstrates the use of conditional tasks. We will check if the target machines are running a specific version of Ubuntu before executing tasks.

#### Example Playbook: `conditional_playbook.yml`

```yaml
---
- name: Conditional Tasks Example
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Check if the OS is Ubuntu 20.04
      command: lsb_release -a
      register: result

    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: latest
      when: "'Ubuntu 20.04' in result.stdout"
```

### Detailed Code Examples

Let’s break down the tasks in the example playbook:

1. **Check OS Version:**
   - The `command` module executes the command `lsb_release -a` on the target machine.
   - The `register` keyword saves the output of the command to the variable `result`.

2. **Conditional Installation:**
   - The `apt` module handles package management tasks on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.
   - The `when` statement checks if the string 'Ubuntu 20.04' is present in the `stdout` of the `result`.
   - If the condition is true, Ansible proceeds to install nginx.

### Step 4: Running the Playbook

Execute the playbook with the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook conditional_playbook.yml -i your_inventory_file
```

Replace `your_inventory_file` with the path to your inventory file.

## Conclusion

Conditional tasks are a cornerstone of writing efficient and adaptable Ansible playbooks. By using the `when` clause, you can tailor your automation to fit the specific characteristics and requirements of your environment. This not only makes your playbooks more robust but also prevents unnecessary operations, thereby optimizing performance. As you become more familiar with conditionals, you'll find various ways to enhance and refine your automation strategies using Ansible.
