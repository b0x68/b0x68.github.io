# Tech Tutorial: Install and Configure an Ansible Control Node

## Introduction

Ansible is a powerful IT automation tool that simplifies cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. One of its core components is the management of hosts through inventories, which can be static or dynamic. In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up an Ansible control node and create static inventories to efficiently manage groups of hosts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A Linux-based system to set up the Ansible control node (Ubuntu/Debian/CentOS).
- One or more remote servers to manage with Ansible.
- Sudo or root privileges on all systems.
- SSH access configured between the Ansible control node and the managed hosts.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing Ansible

First, let's install Ansible on your control node. The method may vary depending on your Linux distribution.

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

#### On CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible
```

After installation, verify it by running:
```bash
ansible --version
```

### Step 2: Setting Up SSH Keys

For Ansible to communicate with your managed nodes, set up SSH key-based authentication.

1. Generate an SSH key pair on your control node:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
   ```
2. Copy the public key to each managed host:
   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user@host_ip_address
   ```

Replace `user` with the remote user’s username and `host_ip_address` with the host's IP address.

### Step 3: Create a Static Inventory File

Ansible uses inventory files to track which servers it can communicate with. Here’s how to create a static inventory.

1. Create a directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/ansible-project
   cd ~/ansible-project
   ```

2. Create an inventory file:
   ```bash
   nano inventory
   ```

3. Add the following contents:
   ```ini
   [web_servers]
   web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
   web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

   [db_servers]
   db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.201
   db2 ansible_host=192.168.1.202
   ```

Here, two groups (`web_servers` and `db_servers`) are defined, each containing two hosts.

### Step 4: Test Ansible Communication

To check if Ansible can communicate with the hosts listed in your inventory, run:
```bash
ansible -i inventory all -m ping
```

Each machine should respond with a `SUCCESS` message.

## Detailed Code Examples

Let’s explore more complex inventory setups and some Ansible commands:

#### Advanced Inventory Example

```ini
[all:vars]
ansible_user=ubuntu

[web_servers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[db_servers]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.201
db2 ansible_host=192.168.1.202

[prod:children]
web_servers
db_servers
```

This setup introduces a parent group `prod` which contains both `web_servers` and `db_servers`. The `ansible_user` variable is set globally for all hosts.

#### Running Ad-hoc Commands

Check disk space on all database servers:
```bash
ansible -i inventory db_servers -m shell -a 'df -h'
```

## Conclusion

By now, you should have a basic Ansible control node setup with a static inventory that can manage multiple hosts. Static inventories are straightforward and work well for environments with little change in infrastructure. As you get more comfortable with Ansible, you can explore dynamic inventories, which are essential for managing scalable and frequently changing cloud environments. Happy automating!
