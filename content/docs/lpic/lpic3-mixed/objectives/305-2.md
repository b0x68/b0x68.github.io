# Tech Tutorial: 305.2 FreeIPA Entity Management (weight: 4)

## Introduction
FreeIPA is an integrated Identity and Authentication solution for Linux/UNIX networked environments. A FreeIPA server provides centralized authentication, authorization, and account information by storing data about user, groups, hosts, and other objects necessary to manage the security aspects of a network of computers. In this tutorial, we will focus on how to manage users, hosts, and services in a FreeIPA domain, covering the essential commands and procedures.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- User management
- Host management
- Service management
- Use of FreeIPA command-line utilities

## Utilities:
- `ipa user-*`
- `ipa host-*`
- `ipa service-*`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Managing Users
FreeIPA provides a robust set of command-line utilities to manage users within the domain. Here are common tasks you might need to perform:

#### Adding a New User
```bash
ipa user-add jdoe --first=John --last=Doe --email=jdoe@example.com --password
```
This command adds a new user with a username `jdoe`. It prompts you to enter a password for the user.

#### Modifying a User
```bash
ipa user-mod jdoe --shell=/bin/bash
```
This modifies the user `jdoe` to change their login shell to `/bin/bash`.

#### Finding Users
```bash
ipa user-find --last=Doe
```
This searches for users with the last name "Doe".

#### Deleting a User
```bash
ipa user-del jdoe
```
This command deletes the user `jdoe` from the FreeIPA database.

### 2. Managing Hosts
Managing hosts involves adding, modifying, and deleting host entries in the FreeIPA domain.

#### Adding a New Host
```bash
ipa host-add server01.example.com --ip-address=192.168.1.100 --password
```
This adds a new host `server01.example.com` with the specified IP address.

#### Modifying a Host
```bash
ipa host-mod server01.example.com --description="New server"
```
This command updates the description of the host `server01.example.com`.

#### Finding Hosts
```bash
ipa host-find --ip-address=192.168.1.100
```
Searches for hosts with the specific IP address.

#### Deleting a Host
```bash
ipa host-del server01.example.com
```
Deletes the host `server01.example.com`.

### 3. Managing Services
Services in FreeIPA are often used in the context of service principals for Kerberos.

#### Adding a Service
```bash
ipa service-add HTTP/server01.example.com
```
This command creates a new service principal for HTTP on `server01.example.com`.

#### Modifying a Service
```bash
ipa service-mod HTTP/server01.example.com --addattr=description="Web service"
```
Modifies the service principal to add a description.

#### Finding Services
```bash
ipa service-find HTTP
```
Finds all services with the "HTTP" in their name.

#### Deleting a Service
```bash
ipa service-del HTTP/server01.example.com
```
Deletes the specified service principal.

## Conclusion
This tutorial covered the basic operations for managing users, hosts, and services in a FreeIPA domain using various `ipa` command-line utilities. Mastering these commands is crucial for effective administration of FreeIPA in enterprise environments. Regular practice and usage will help in solidifying your understanding and efficiency in managing FreeIPA entities.
