# Tech Tutorial: 302.5 Samba Local User Management (weight: 2)

## Introduction

This tutorial will explore managing local user accounts on a standalone Samba server. Samba is a powerful tool that allows for file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Understanding how to manage user accounts is crucial for maintaining access controls and ensuring the security and efficiency of a Samba server.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Samba user management
- Interaction between system and Samba users
- Samba utilities for user management

## Utilities:

- `smbpasswd`
- `pdbedit`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installation and Basic Configuration of Samba

Before we start managing users, ensure that Samba is installed and configured on your system. You can install Samba using your distributionâ€™s package manager.

For Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
```

For Red Hat-based systems:

```bash
sudo yum install samba
```

Configure Samba by editing the configuration file located at `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. Here's a basic example to get started:

```ini
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   security = user
   map to guest = bad user

[homes]
   comment = Home Directories
   browseable = no
   writable = yes
```

### Step 2: System User vs. Samba User

A Samba user must correspond to a system user. This means that before you add a user to Samba, that user must exist on the system.

Create a new system user (skip if the user already exists):

```bash
sudo adduser samuser
```

Set a password for the new system user:

```bash
sudo passwd samuser
```

### Step 3: Adding a Samba User

#### Using `smbpasswd`

To add a user to Samba and set a password, use the `smbpasswd` utility:

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -a samuser
```

This command adds 'samuser' to the Samba database and prompts you to enter a password for the user.

#### Detailed Code Example for `smbpasswd`:

To enable a Samba user:

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -e samuser
```

To disable a Samba user:

```bash
sudo smbpasswd -d samuser
```

### Step 4: Managing Samba Users with `pdbedit`

`pdbedit` is a tool for managing the Samba user database.

To list all Samba users:

```bash
sudo pdbedit -L
```

To view detailed information about a specific Samba user:

```bash
sudo pdbedit -Lv samuser
```

#### Detailed Code Example for `pdbedit`:

To add or modify a Samba user:

```bash
sudo pdbedit -a -u samuser -f "Sam User"
```

To delete a Samba user:

```bash
sudo pdbedit -x -u samuser
```

### Step 5: Testing Samba User Access

Ensure the user can access the Samba share. From a client machine, try accessing the share:

```bash
smbclient //your-server-ip/homes -U samuser
```

You will be prompted for the user's Samba password, and upon successful authentication, you should have access to the share.

## Conclusion

Managing local user accounts on a Samba server is a critical part of maintaining an efficient and secure file sharing environment. By understanding and utilizing tools like `smbpasswd` and `pdbedit`, administrators can ensure that only authorized users have access to the necessary resources. Regularly reviewing and managing these accounts as part of your system administration practices will help in maintaining the overall health and security of your Samba installations.
