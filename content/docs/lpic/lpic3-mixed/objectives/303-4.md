# Tech Tutorial: 303.4 Print Share Configuration

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create and manage print shares using Samba, a popular software suite that facilitates file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. Samba allows Linux systems to interact with Windows clients and vice versa, making it a crucial tool in mixed-OS environments. Understanding how to configure Samba for sharing printers is essential for system administrators who manage networked environments.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Samba configuration for printer sharing
- Management and troubleshooting of Samba print shares

## Utilities:
- `smb.conf`
- `testparm`
- `smbclient`
- `lpadmin`
- `cupsd`

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have Samba and CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) installed on your Linux system. Both are required to share printers on a network.

### Installing Samba and CUPS
On a Debian-based system, you can install these using:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba cups
```

For RedHat-based systems:
```bash
sudo yum install samba cups
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Configure CUPS
First, we need to ensure that CUPS is configured to allow sharing of printers. Edit the CUPS configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
```

Add or ensure these lines exist:
```conf
Listen localhost:631
Browsing On
BrowseOrder allow,deny
BrowseAllow all
BrowseLocalProtocols CUPS dnssd
DefaultAuthType Basic
<Location />
  Order allow,deny
  Allow @LOCAL
</Location>
<Location /admin>
  Order allow,deny
  Allow @LOCAL
</Location>
<Location /admin/conf>
  AuthType Default
  Require user @SYSTEM
  Order allow,deny
  Allow @LOCAL
</Location>
```

Restart CUPS to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart cups
```

### Step 2: Add Printer to CUPS
You can add a printer to CUPS using the web interface (http://localhost:631) or via the command line:
```bash
sudo lpadmin -p Printer_Name -E -v device_URI -m driver_name
```

Example:
```bash
sudo lpadmin -p Office_Printer -E -v usb://HP/LaserJet%201020 -m hplip
```

### Step 3: Configure Samba to Share the Printer
Edit your Samba configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Add the following section:
```ini
[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /usr/share/cups/drivers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

### Step 4: Restart Samba and Test Configuration
Restart Samba to apply your new configuration:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
```

Check your Samba configuration for any syntax errors:
```bash
sudo testparm
```

### Step 5: Access and Test the Printer Share
From a Windows client in the same network, you can now access the shared printer by navigating to `\\<SAMBA-SERVER-IP>\Printer_Name`. Install the necessary drivers if prompted.

## Detailed Code Examples for Common Commands

### smbclient - Testing SMB/CIFS connection and browsing shares
List available shares:
```bash
smbclient -L //<server-ip> -U <username>
```

### lpadmin - Managing printers in CUPS
Adding a new printer:
```bash
sudo lpadmin -p Office_Printer -E -v usb://HP/LaserJet%201020 -m hplip
```

### cupsd - Managing the CUPS service
Restarting CUPS service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart cups
```

## Conclusion

Configuring Samba for printer sharing involves setting up both CUPS and Samba to work together. This setup enables users on a network to access printers hosted on a Linux server as if they were connected to their own Windows machines. Properly managing these services ensures a seamless and efficient printing environment in mixed-OS scenarios.
