# Tech Tutorial: 303.1 File Share Configuration (weight: 4)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will dive into setting up and configuring CIFS (Common Internet File System) file shares using Samba on a Linux system. Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and provides file and print services to SMB/CIFS clients. It allows the Linux system to interact with Windows clients and act as a server for files and printers.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux system with administrative privileges.
- Samba installed on your Linux system.
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line and file permissions.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Installation and configuration of Samba.
- Management of Samba users.
- Creation and configuration of CIFS file shares.

## Utilities

- `smb.conf`
- `smbpasswd`
- `testparm`
- `smbclient`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing Samba

To install Samba on a Debian-based system, use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install samba
```

For Red Hat-based systems, you can use:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install samba
```

### Step 2: Configuring Samba

The main configuration file for Samba is `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. You need to edit this file to set up your file shares.

1. **Backup the original configuration file:**

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup
   ```

2. **Edit the configuration file:**

   Open the file with your favorite text editor, for example:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration to set up a simple share:

   ```ini
   [global]
       workgroup = WORKGROUP
       server string = Samba Server %v
       netbios name = linuxbox
       security = user
       map to guest = bad user
       dns proxy = no

   [shared]
       path = /srv/samba/shared
       writable = yes
       guest ok = yes
       guest only = yes
       read only = no
       force user = nobody
   ```

   This configuration does the following:
   - Sets the workgroup and server name.
   - Configures the server to use user-level security.
   - Defines a share named `[shared]` that is accessible by guests.

3. **Check the configuration for errors:**

   ```bash
   sudo testparm
   ```

### Step 3: Adding Samba Users

To access the Samba shares, users must be added to the Samba user database.

1. **Create a new Linux user (if necessary):**

   ```bash
   sudo adduser samuser
   ```

2. **Add the user to Samba:**

   ```bash
   sudo smbpasswd -a samuser
   ```

   When prompted, enter and confirm the password for the Samba user.

### Step 4: Managing Samba Service

Start, stop, and restart the Samba service as needed:

```bash
sudo systemctl start smbd
sudo systemctl stop smbd
sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

### Step 5: Accessing the Share

Use `smbclient` to access the share from the command line:

```bash
smbclient //localhost/shared -U samuser
```

Enter the password when prompted, and you should have access to the shared directory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you've learned how to set up and configure a Samba server to provide CIFS file shares. You've installed Samba, configured a file share, managed Samba users, and accessed the share using `smbclient`. This setup is fundamental for creating a file-sharing network in a mixed environment with Windows and Linux systems.
