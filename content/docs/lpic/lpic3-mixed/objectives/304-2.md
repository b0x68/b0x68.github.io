# Tech Tutorial: 304.2 Linux CIFS Clients

In this tutorial, we will explore how to interact with CIFS (Common Internet File System) shares from a Linux client. This tutorial is particularly beneficial for those preparing for the Linux certification exams, specifically focusing on the objective of managing CIFS shares.

## Introduction

CIFS, also known as SMB (Server Message Block), is a network file sharing protocol that allows systems to access files, printers, and other networked services. Linux, with the help of Samba and other tools, can act as both a client and a server in CIFS networks.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Mounting and unmounting CIFS shares
- Managing CIFS credentials
- Handling remote ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- Managing quotas on remote shares

## Utilities:

- `mount.cifs`
- `umount`
- `smbclient`
- `getfacl`
- `setfacl`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installing Required Packages

Before interacting with CIFS shares, ensure that the necessary tools are installed on your Linux system. The `cifs-utils` and `samba-client` packages are commonly required.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cifs-utils samba-client
```

### 2. Mounting CIFS Shares

To mount a CIFS share, you can use the `mount.cifs` command. You'll need to specify the share path, the mount point, and the credentials.

#### Example:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/cifsshare
sudo mount.cifs //server/sharename /mnt/cifsshare -o username=user,password=password
```

**Note:** Itâ€™s safer to use a credentials file instead of passing username and password directly in the command.

#### Using a Credentials File:

Create a file with username and password:

```bash
echo "username=myuser" > ~/.cifscredentials
echo "password=mypassword" >> ~/.cifscredentials
chmod 600 ~/.cifscredentials
```

Now, mount the share using the credentials file:

```bash
sudo mount.cifs //server/sharename /mnt/cifsshare -o cred=/home/yourusername/.cifscredentials
```

### 3. Unmounting CIFS Shares

To unmount a CIFS share, use the `umount` command.

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/cifsshare
```

### 4. Managing Remote ACLs

Access control lists (ACLs) on CIFS shares can be managed using `getfacl` and `setfacl` commands, but these must be supported by the server.

#### Viewing ACLs:

```bash
getfacl /mnt/cifsshare/examplefile
```

#### Setting ACLs:

```bash
setfacl -m u:username:rwx /mnt/cifsshare/examplefile
```

### 5. Managing Quotas on Remote Shares

Managing quotas on CIFS shares can be more complex and might require administrative access on the server. Typically, this is managed on the server side.

### 6. Using `smbclient` for Accessing Shares

`smbclient` is a useful tool for accessing CIFS shares without mounting them.

#### Listing Shares:

```bash
smbclient -L //server -U user
```

#### Connecting to a Share:

```bash
smbclient //server/sharename -U user
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to interact with CIFS shares from a Linux client, including mounting and unmounting shares, handling credentials securely, and managing ACLs and quotas. By mastering these skills, you can efficiently manage file shares in a networked environment, an essential skill for system administrators.

This knowledge not only helps in real-world scenarios but also prepares you for relevant sections of Linux certification exams. Remember, hands-on practice is crucial to mastering these commands and concepts.
