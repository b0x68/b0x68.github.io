# Tech Tutorial: 305.3 FreeIPA Active Directory Integration (weight: 2)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to establish a cross-forest trust between a FreeIPA domain and an Active Directory (AD) domain. This is a crucial skill for system administrators who manage hybrid networks consisting of both Linux and Windows machines. Establishing a trust relationship allows users from one domain to access resources in the other domain seamlessly.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding of DNS and AD requirements for trusts
- Installation and configuration of FreeIPA
- Establishing trust relations between FreeIPA and AD
- Managing permissions and access controls in a cross-forest environment

## Utilities:

- `ipa`
- `realm`
- `kinit`
- `net ads`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Ensure that you have two servers available: one for FreeIPA and one for Active Directory. Both servers should be properly configured with static IP addresses, fully qualified domain names (FQDN), and correct DNS settings.

#### Example Setup:

- FreeIPA Server: `ipa.example.com` (IP: `192.168.1.10`)
- Active Directory Server: `ad.example.com` (IP: `192.168.1.20`)

### Step 2: Installing FreeIPA

Install the FreeIPA server on a CentOS/RHEL system. Ensure the system is updated and has the required packages.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install ipa-server ipa-server-dns -y
```

Configure the FreeIPA server. During setup, specify DNS and the domain details. 

```bash
sudo ipa-server-install --setup-dns --forwarder=8.8.8.8 --no-forwarders --realm=EXAMPLE.COM --domain=example.com --ds-password=password --admin-password=adminpass
```

Replace `--forwarder`, `--realm`, `--domain`, `--ds-password`, and `--admin-password` with appropriate values.

### Step 3: Setting up Active Directory

Set up an AD domain controller on a Windows Server. This guide assumes you have Windows Server installed and ready to configure.

1. Open "Server Manager".
2. Add roles and features, install "Active Directory Domain Services", and promote the server to a domain controller.

### Step 4: Establishing Trust Relationship

On the FreeIPA server, initialize Kerberos:

```bash
kinit admin
```

#### Create a Trust:

Use the `ipa` command to establish a trust with the AD domain.

```bash
ipa trust-add --type=ad ad.example.com --admin Administrator --password
```

This command will prompt for the AD domain administrator's password.

### Step 5: Verify the Trust

Check the trust status using:

```bash
ipa trust-show ad.example.com
```

### Step 6: Access Control and Permissions

Manage access controls and permissions from the FreeIPA web interface or CLI to allow specific AD users or groups to access resources in the IPA domain.

### Step 7: Testing the Trust

From an AD joined Windows machine, try accessing a resource on the IPA domain using an AD user credentials.

## Conclusion

Setting up a cross-forest trust between FreeIPA and Active Directory allows organizations to manage a mixed environment more effectively. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, system administrators can ensure seamless access between Linux and Windows systems, enhancing productivity and security across the network. Regularly monitor and adjust permissions as required to maintain a secure and efficient integrated environment.
