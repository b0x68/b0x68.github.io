# Tech Tutorial: 301.1 Samba Concepts and Architecture (weight: 2)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the essential concepts of Samba, focusing on its architecture, server processes, and the networking protocols it uses in various roles. Samba is an open-source implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol that allows Linux systems to communicate with Windows systems for file and print services. We will explore Samba version 4.8 or higher, which includes numerous enhancements and features compared to earlier versions.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Samba server processes
- Samba networking protocols
- Roles of Samba in a network environment

## Utilities:

- `smbd`
- `nmbd`
- `winbindd`
- `samba-tool`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Samba Server Processes

Samba operates mainly through three daemon processes: `smbd`, `nmbd`, and `winbindd`. Understanding these daemons is crucial for managing a Samba server.

#### smbd

The `smbd` daemon handles file and printer sharing, as well as user authentication requests from clients. It listens on TCP port 445.

**Example:**

```bash
# Start the smbd service
sudo systemctl start smbd

# Check the status of the smbd service
sudo systemctl status smbd
```

#### nmbd

The `nmbd` daemon provides NetBIOS over IP naming services to clients. It listens on UDP ports 137 and 138.

**Example:**

```bash
# Start the nmbd service
sudo systemctl start nmbd

# Check the status of the nmbd service
sudo systemctl status nmbd
```

#### winbindd

The `winbindd` daemon is responsible for resolving user and group information from Windows NT servers, allowing Unix systems to authenticate users based on Windows domain credentials.

**Example:**

```bash
# Start the winbindd service
sudo systemctl start winbindd

# Check the status of the winbindd service
sudo systemctl status winbindd
```

### 2. Networking Protocols

Samba uses various networking protocols to provide seamless integration between Linux/Unix servers and Windows clients.

- **SMB/CIFS:** The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, also known as the Common Internet File System (CIFS), is used by Samba to provide shared access to files, printers, and serial ports.
- **NetBIOS:** Used for legacy support in network browsing and name resolution.

### 3. Samba Roles

Samba can serve as:
- A standalone server
- A domain member
- A domain controller

For each role, specific configuration adjustments are necessary.

#### Example: Configuring Samba as a Standalone Server

```bash
# Install Samba
sudo apt-get install samba

# Configure Samba
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

# Add the following to smb.conf
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   server string = Samba Server %v
   netbios name = ubuntu
   security = user
   map to guest = bad user
   dns proxy = no

[public]
   path = /srv/samba/
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   guest only = yes
   force user = nobody

# Restart Samba services
sudo systemctl restart smbd nmbd
```

### 4. Samba Tool Usage

The `samba-tool` is a powerful command-line tool used for various administrative tasks in Samba, including creating domains, managing users, and setting up domain controllers.

**Example: Creating a new user**

```bash
samba-tool user add newuser --random-password
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the essential aspects of Samba, including its server processes, networking protocols, and roles. Understanding these components is crucial for effectively setting up and managing Samba in various network environments. With the practical examples provided, you should be well-equipped to handle basic Samba administration tasks aligned with the Samba version 4.8 or higher.
