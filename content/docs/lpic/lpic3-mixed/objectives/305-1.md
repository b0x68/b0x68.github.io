# Tech Tutorial: 305.1 FreeIPA Installation and Maintenance

## Introduction

FreeIPA is an integrated Identity and Authentication solution for Linux/UNIX networked environments. A FreeIPA server provides centralized authentication, authorization, and account information by storing data about user, groups, hosts, and other objects necessary to manage the security aspects of a network of computers. In this tutorial, we will cover the setup and management of a FreeIPA domain, including replication and client integration.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Installation of FreeIPA server
- Configuration of FreeIPA server
- Managing FreeIPA services
- Setting up replication
- Joining clients to the domain

## Utilities:
- `ipa-server-install`
- `ipa-replica-install`
- `ipa-client-install`
- `ipa`
- `ipa-replica-manage`
- `ipa-csreplica-manage`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installation of FreeIPA Server

To begin with, you need a CentOS or RHEL-based system. Make sure your system is updated and has a proper hostname.

```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname ipa.example.com
```

Install the FreeIPA server package:

```bash
sudo yum install ipa-server -y
```

Now, install the FreeIPA server with an integrated DNS. This step requires some interactive configuration such as specifying the domain name and setting up an administrative password.

```bash
sudo ipa-server-install --setup-dns --forwarder=8.8.8.8 --no-forwarders
```

During the installation, you will be prompted for various settings like domain, realm, DNS forwarder, and the Directory Manager's password.

### 2. Managing FreeIPA Services

After installation, you can manage FreeIPA services using the `ipa` command-line utility. Start by checking the status of all services:

```bash
ipa service-status
```

You can start, stop, or restart services using this utility:

```bash
ipa service-restart
ipa service-stop
ipa service-start
```

### 3. Setting Up Replication

Setting up replication involves installing a replica of your primary FreeIPA server on another server. First, install the necessary packages on the replica server:

```bash
sudo yum install ipa-server -y
```

Run the replica installation command:

```bash
sudo ipa-replica-install --principal admin --admin-password <AdminPassword>
```

You will need to provide the principal and admin password used in the primary server during the setup.

### 4. Joining Clients to the Domain

To join a client to the FreeIPA domain, install the FreeIPA client package:

```bash
sudo yum install ipa-client -y
```

Now, join the client to the domain:

```bash
sudo ipa-client-install --principal admin --password <AdminPassword> --mkhomedir
```

This command requires an administrative principal and password. It also creates home directories for users upon their first login.

## Detailed Code Examples

Let's go through more detailed usage of the `ipa` command.

**Adding a User:**

```bash
ipa user-add jdoe --first=John --last=Doe --password
```

**Adding a Host:**

```bash
ipa host-add host1.example.com
```

**Modifying a User:**

```bash
ipa user-mod jdoe --shell=/bin/bash
```

**Finding a User:**

```bash
ipa user-find jdoe
```

**Deleting a User:**

```bash
ipa user-del jdoe
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have gone through the installation and basic management of a FreeIPA server, including how to set up replication and join clients to the domain. FreeIPA is a powerful tool for managing identities and policies in a networked environment, providing a centralized platform that simplifies user and host management. By following this guide, you should be able to establish a robust identity management system using FreeIPA.
