# Tech Tutorial: 302.3 Active Directory User Management

## Introduction

This tutorial is designed to help system administrators and IT professionals understand how to manage user and group accounts on standalone servers and within a Samba-based Active Directory environment. Managing user accounts and permissions is crucial for maintaining the security and efficiency of your IT infrastructure.

In this guide, we'll cover the necessary steps and commands to efficiently handle user and group accounts using different utilities, with a focus on Samba for Active Directory integration.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- User and group add/mod/del
- User on standalone server
- User in Samba Active Directory
- Group on standalone server
- Group in Samba Active Directory

## Utilities:
- `useradd`, `usermod`, `userdel`
- `groupadd`, `groupmod`, `groupdel`
- `samba-tool`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Managing Users on a Standalone Server

#### Adding a New User
To add a new user in Linux, use the `useradd` command. Here's how to add a user named `jdoe`:

```bash
sudo useradd jdoe
```

To set a password for the user, use the `passwd` command:

```bash
sudo passwd jdoe
```

#### Modifying a User
To modify an existing user, for example changing the login name from `jdoe` to `john_doe`, use `usermod`:

```bash
sudo usermod -l john_doe jdoe
```

#### Deleting a User
To delete a user, use the `userdel` command. To remove `john_doe` along with his home directory:

```bash
sudo userdel -r john_doe
```

### Managing Groups on a Standalone Server

#### Adding a New Group
To add a new group named `developers`:

```bash
sudo groupadd developers
```

#### Modifying a Group
To modify a group, for example to change the name from `developers` to `dev_team`:

```bash
sudo groupmod -n dev_team developers
```

#### Deleting a Group
To delete the group `dev_team`:

```bash
sudo groupdel dev_team
```

### Managing Users in Samba Active Directory

#### Adding a New User
To add a new user to the Samba AD, use `samba-tool`:

```bash
sudo samba-tool user add jdoe --given-name=John --surname=Doe --random-password
```

#### Modifying a User
To modify an existing user in Samba AD, for example to change the user's surname:

```bash
sudo samba-tool user edit jdoe
```
This command opens an editor to allow detailed modifications in the userâ€™s attributes.

#### Deleting a User
To delete a user from Samba AD:

```bash
sudo samba-tool user delete jdoe
```

### Managing Groups in Samba Active Directory

#### Adding a New Group
To add a new group in Samba AD:

```bash
sudo samba-tool group add developers
```

#### Modifying a Group
To modify a group in Samba AD:

```bash
sudo samba-tool group edit developers
```
This opens an editor for detailed modifications.

#### Deleting a Group
To delete a group from Samba AD:

```bash
sudo samba-tool group delete developers
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to manage users and groups on both standalone Linux servers and in a Samba-based Active Directory environment. Using the commands and procedures outlined, you can effectively manage your IT infrastructure's user accounts and permissions. Regular management of user and group accounts ensures security and operational efficiency in an organization.

Feel free to experiment with the commands and tailor the parameters to fit the specific needs of your environment. Always ensure you have proper backups and restoration processes in place before making significant changes to your user and group settings.
