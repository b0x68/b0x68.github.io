# Tech Tutorial: 303.2 File Share Security (weight: 3)

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will delve into the management of file permissions on both Linux file systems and CIFS (Common Internet File System) shares. Understanding file permissions is crucial for securing data and ensuring that only authorized users and systems have access to specific files.

## Key Knowledge Areas
- Understanding Linux file permissions
- Managing CIFS file share permissions
- Utilizing command-line tools to set and view permissions

## Utilities
- `chmod`
- `chown`
- `ls`
- `getfacl`
- `setfacl`
- `smbclient`
- `mount.cifs`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Linux File Permissions

#### Viewing Permissions
To view the permissions of files and directories in Linux, we use the `ls` command with the `-l` option:

```bash
ls -l filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 Sep 29 12:00 myfile.txt
```

This output shows that `myfile.txt` is readable and writable by the owner (`user`), readable by the group (`group`), and readable by others.

#### Changing Ownership
The `chown` command is used to change the owner and group of a file:

```bash
chown newowner:newgroup filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ chown alice:staff myfile.txt
```

#### Modifying Permissions
The `chmod` command changes the file modes or Access Control Lists (ACLs). Hereâ€™s how you can give the owner execute permissions:

```bash
chmod u+x filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ chmod u+x myfile.txt
```

To set specific permissions using numeric mode:

```bash
chmod 755 filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ chmod 755 myfile.txt
```

### Advanced Permissions with ACLs

#### Viewing ACLs
ACLs provide more granular permissions. To view the ACLs:

```bash
getfacl filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ getfacl myfile.txt
# file: myfile.txt
# owner: alice
# group: staff
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--
```

#### Setting ACLs
To grant specific users or groups permissions:

```bash
setfacl -m u:username:rwx filename
```

Example:
```bash
$ setfacl -m u:bob:rwx myfile.txt
```

### Managing CIFS Shares

#### Using `smbclient` to Access Shares
To list available shares on a server:

```bash
smbclient -L //servername -U username
```

Example:
```bash
$ smbclient -L //192.168.1.100 -U alice
```

#### Mounting CIFS Shares
To mount a CIFS share on a Linux system, use `mount.cifs`:

```bash
sudo mount.cifs //servername/sharename /mnt/share -o user=username
```

Example:
```bash
$ sudo mount.cifs //192.168.1.100/data /mnt/data -o user=alice
```

### Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered essential aspects of managing file permissions on Linux file systems and CIFS shares. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can effectively secure data accesses in a multi-user or networked environment. Always ensure to test permissions settings in a safe testing environment before applying them in production to avoid accidental data exposure or loss.

This comprehensive guide should equip you with the knowledge to handle file permissions adeptly on both local Linux systems and network CIFS shares, helping you secure your systems in line with best practices.
