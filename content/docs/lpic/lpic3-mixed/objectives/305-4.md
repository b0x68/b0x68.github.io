# Tech Tutorial: 305.4 Network File System (NFSv4)

## Introduction

NFS (Network File System) is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. NFSv4, the fourth version of NFS, includes improvements over its predecessors, such as better performance, security features, and support for ACLs (Access Control Lists). In this tutorial, weâ€™ll delve into setting up an NFSv4 server, configuring ID mapping, using NFSv4 ACLs, and securing NFS with Kerberos authentication.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Setting up an NFSv4 server
- Configuring NFS clients
- Understanding and implementing ID mapping
- Managing NFSv4 ACLs
- Configuring Kerberos for NFS

## Utilities:

- `exportfs`
- `showmount`
- `nfsstat`
- `mount`
- `umount`
- `rpcinfo`

## Prerequisites

- Two Linux machines (one as an NFS server, one as a client)
- Network connectivity between both machines
- Sudo or root privileges on both machines
- Kerberos server if using Kerberos authentication (optional for this tutorial)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setting up the NFS Server

Install NFS packages on your server.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
```

Configure the NFS exports. Create a directory to share and edit `/etc/exports`.

```bash
sudo mkdir /srv/nfs
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/nfs
echo "/srv/nfs 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
```

Export the shares and restart NFS service.

```bash
sudo exportfs -arv
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

### 2. Setting up the NFS Client

Install NFS common packages on your client.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-common
```

Mount the NFS share.

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 192.168.1.100:/srv/nfs /mnt
```

Verify the mount.

```bash
mount | grep nfs
```

### 3. ID Mapping Configuration

Ensure that ID mapping is working properly (This step assumes NFSv4 is used which handles ID mapping differently than NFSv3).

```bash
ls -l /mnt
```

### 4. Managing NFSv4 ACLs

NFSv4 supports ACLs that provide more detailed permission settings compared to traditional UNIX permissions.

Set an ACL on the server.

```bash
nfs4_setfacl -a A::1001:rw /srv/nfs/samplefile
```

Check the ACL on the client.

```bash
nfs4_getfacl /mnt/samplefile
```

### 5. Configuring Kerberos for NFS

Setup Kerberos authentication for NFS. This assumes you have a Kerberos server already configured.

On the server, edit `/etc/default/nfs-kernel-server` to add Kerberos support.

```bash
echo "NEED_SVCGSSD=yes" | sudo tee -a /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server
```

Restart NFS server with Kerberos support.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

On the client, mount the NFS with Kerberos.

```bash
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o sec=krb5 192.168.1.100:/srv/nfs /mnt
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the essentials of setting up NFSv4, from installation and configuration to more advanced topics like ACL management and Kerberos authentication. NFSv4 provides significant improvements in security and functionality over previous versions, making it suitable for modern networked environments. Remember, always test configurations in a secure environment before deploying them in production.
