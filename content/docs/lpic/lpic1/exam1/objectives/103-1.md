## Mastering Command Line Basics: LPIC-1 Exam Objective 103.1

As you prepare for the LPIC-1 certification, mastering the command line is essential. This tutorial covers key aspects of interacting with shells and commands using the command line, focusing on the Bash shell. We'll delve into single shell commands, shell environment modification, command history, and invoking commands inside and outside the defined path.

### Single Shell Commands and One-Line Command Sequences

#### Basic Shell Commands

1. **`echo`**: Print text to the terminal.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

2. **`pwd`**: Print the current working directory.
   ```bash
   pwd
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   /home/user
   ```

3. **`uname`**: Display system information.
   ```bash
   uname -a
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Linux hostname 5.4.0-74-generic #83-Ubuntu SMP Mon May 10 19:18:00 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
   ```

#### One-Line Command Sequences

Combine multiple commands using the `;` separator.

```bash
mkdir test_dir; cd test_dir; touch file1 file2; ls
```

This sequence creates a directory, navigates into it, creates two files, and lists them.

### Shell Environment

#### Defining, Referencing, and Exporting Environment Variables

1. **Defining a variable**:
   ```bash
   MY_VAR="Hello"
   ```

2. **Referencing a variable**:
   ```bash
   echo $MY_VAR
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello
   ```

3. **Exporting a variable**:
   ```bash
   export MY_VAR
   ```

4. **Using `env` to view environment variables**:
   ```bash
   env | grep MY_VAR
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   MY_VAR=Hello
   ```

5. **Unsetting a variable**:
   ```bash
   unset MY_VAR
   ```

### Command History

1. **Viewing command history**:
   ```bash
   history
   ```

2. **Re-running a command from history**:
   ```bash
   !42
   ```
   This runs the command numbered 42 in the history.

3. **Editing history with `history -c`**:
   ```bash
   history -c
   ```
   This clears the command history.

### Invoking Commands

#### Inside the Defined Path

Commands within the system's PATH can be executed directly.

1. **Using `which` to locate executables**:
   ```bash
   which ls
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   /bin/ls
   ```

2. **Using `type` to display command type**:
   ```bash
   type ls
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto`
   ```

#### Outside the Defined Path

To run a script not in the PATH, specify its path.

1. **Running a script from the current directory**:
   ```bash
   ./script.sh
   ```

### Quoting in Shell

Quoting controls the interpretation of special characters.

1. **Double quotes (`"`)**:
   ```bash
   echo "The value of HOME is $HOME"
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   The value of HOME is /home/user
   ```

2. **Single quotes (`'`)**:
   ```bash
   echo 'The value of HOME is $HOME'
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   The value of HOME is $HOME
   ```

3. **Backslash (`\`)** for escaping:
   ```bash
   echo "A quote: \""
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   A quote: "
   ```

### Summary

This tutorial covered the essentials of working on the command line with Bash, including single shell commands, modifying the shell environment, using command history, and invoking commands inside and outside the defined path. Mastering these basics is crucial for success in the LPIC-1 exam and for efficient daily use of the Linux command line. Happy learning!
