## LPIC-1 Exam Objective 103.7: Search Text Files Using Regular Expressions

### Introduction

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for searching, manipulating, and editing text based on patterns. Mastering regex allows you to efficiently manage and process text data, an essential skill for any Linux system administrator. This tutorial covers the essentials of regex, including creating simple expressions, understanding the differences between basic and extended regex, and using various tools like `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep`, and `sed`.

### Key Concepts

1. **Basic vs. Extended Regular Expressions**
2. **Special Characters, Character Classes, Quantifiers, and Anchors**
3. **Regex Tools: grep, egrep, fgrep, and sed**
4. **Performing Searches and Text Manipulation with Regex**

### 1. Basic vs. Extended Regular Expressions

**Basic Regular Expressions (BRE):**
- Used by default with `grep`.
- Meta-characters like `?`, `+`, `{}` need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`).

**Extended Regular Expressions (ERE):**
- Used by `egrep` or `grep -E`.
- More powerful and user-friendly as meta-characters do not need to be escaped.

### 2. Special Characters, Character Classes, Quantifiers, and Anchors

- **Special Characters**: `.` (any character), `^` (beginning of line), `$` (end of line), `\` (escape character)
- **Character Classes**: `[abc]` (matches a, b, or c), `[^abc]` (matches any character except a, b, or c), `[a-z]` (matches any lowercase letter)
- **Quantifiers**: `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), `{n}` (exactly n), `{n,}` (n or more), `{n,m}` (between n and m)
- **Anchors**: `^` (matches the start of a line), `$` (matches the end of a line)

### 3. Regex Tools: grep, egrep, fgrep, and sed

**grep**:
- Searches files for lines that match a given pattern.
- Syntax: `grep [options] pattern [file...]`
  
**egrep**:
- Equivalent to `grep -E`, supports extended regular expressions.
- Syntax: `egrep [options] pattern [file...]`
  
**fgrep**:
- Equivalent to `grep -F`, matches fixed strings (no regex).
- Syntax: `fgrep [options] pattern [file...]`

**sed**:
- Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
- Syntax: `sed [options] script [input-file]`

### 4. Performing Searches and Text Manipulation with Regex

#### Ubuntu/Debian Example

**Searching for a pattern in a file:**

```bash
# Basic regex with grep
grep 'pattern' file.txt

# Extended regex with egrep
egrep 'pattern' file.txt

# Using sed to search and replace
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

**Advanced Searches:**

```bash
# Find lines that start with 'start' and end with 'end'
grep '^start.*end$' file.txt

# Find lines containing at least one digit
grep '[0-9]' file.txt

# Replace all occurrences of 'foo' with 'bar'
sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
```

#### Enterprise Linux Example (RHEL/CentOS)

**Searching for a pattern in a file:**

```bash
# Basic regex with grep
grep 'pattern' file.txt

# Extended regex with grep -E
grep -E 'pattern' file.txt

# Using sed to search and replace
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

**Advanced Searches:**

```bash
# Find lines that start with 'start' and end with 'end'
grep '^start.*end$' file.txt

# Find lines containing at least one digit
grep '[0-9]' file.txt

# Replace all occurrences of 'foo' with 'bar'
sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
```

### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Finding all .conf files in /etc**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
grep -rl '\.conf' /etc

# Enterprise Linux
grep -rl '\.conf' /etc
```

**Example 2: Extracting email addresses from a file**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
grep -E '[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}' file.txt

# Enterprise Linux
grep -E '[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}' file.txt
```

### Conclusion

Understanding and utilizing regular expressions can significantly enhance your ability to manage and process text files in Linux. By mastering tools like `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep`, and `sed`, and comprehending the differences between basic and extended regex, you'll be well-equipped to handle complex text manipulation tasks, a crucial component of the LPIC-1 certification.
