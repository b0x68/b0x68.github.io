## Managing Runlevels and Boot Targets with SysVinit and Systemd

In this tutorial, we'll cover the key aspects of changing runlevels, boot targets, shutting down, and rebooting a system for the LPIC-1 exam. Weâ€™ll explore both SysVinit and systemd, including setting default runlevels/boot targets, alerting users, and properly terminating processes.

### 1. Setting the Default Runlevel or Boot Target

#### SysVinit

SysVinit uses the `/etc/inittab` file to set the default runlevel.

1. **Open `/etc/inittab` for editing:**

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/inittab
    ```

2. **Set the default runlevel:**  
   Look for the line that starts with `id:` and set the desired runlevel. For example, to set the default runlevel to 3:

    ```plaintext
    id:3:initdefault:
    ```

#### Systemd

Systemd uses targets instead of runlevels. The default target is typically a symbolic link to a target file.

1. **View the current default target:**

    ```bash
    systemctl get-default
    ```

2. **Set the default target:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target
    ```

### 2. Changing Runlevels/Boot Targets

#### SysVinit

1. **Change to a different runlevel:**  
   Use the `init` or `telinit` command followed by the runlevel number. For example, to switch to runlevel 1 (single-user mode):

    ```bash
    sudo init 1
    ```

#### Systemd

1. **Change to a different target:**  
   Use the `systemctl isolate` command followed by the target name. For example, to switch to rescue mode (single-user mode):

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl isolate rescue.target
    ```

### 3. Shutting Down and Rebooting

#### SysVinit

1. **Shutdown the system:**

    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -h now
    ```

2. **Reboot the system:**

    ```bash
    sudo shutdown -r now
    ```

#### Systemd

1. **Shutdown the system:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl poweroff
    ```

2. **Reboot the system:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl reboot
    ```

### 4. Alerting Users Before Switching Runlevels/Boot Targets

1. **Send a message to all logged-in users using `wall`:**

    ```bash
    sudo wall "System will switch to single-user mode in 5 minutes. Please save your work."
    ```

### 5. Properly Terminating Processes

#### SysVinit

1. **Gracefully terminate processes before changing runlevels:**  
   This is typically handled by the scripts in `/etc/init.d/`. For example, stopping the Apache service:

    ```bash
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
    ```

#### Systemd

1. **Stop a service before changing targets:**  
   Use `systemctl stop` followed by the service name. For example, stopping the Apache service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop apache2
    ```

### 6. Awareness of `acpid`

`acpid` (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface Daemon) handles power-related events, such as closing a laptop lid or pressing a power button.

1. **Check if `acpid` is installed and running:**

    ```bash
    systemctl status acpid
    ```

2. **Install `acpid` if necessary:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install acpid
    ```

3. **Start `acpid`:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start acpid
    ```

### Key Files, Terms, and Utilities

- **`/etc/inittab`:** Configuration file for SysVinit to set default runlevel.
- **`shutdown`:** Command to shutdown or reboot the system.
- **`init` and `telinit`:** Commands to change runlevels in SysVinit.
- **`/etc/init.d/`:** Directory containing init scripts for SysVinit.
- **`systemd` and `systemctl`:** Tools for managing systemd services and targets.
- **`/etc/systemd/` and `/usr/lib/systemd/`:** Directories containing systemd configuration and service files.
- **`wall`:** Command to send messages to all logged-in users.

By mastering these concepts and commands, you'll be well-prepared to manage runlevels and boot targets effectively, a crucial skill for passing the LPIC-1 exam.
