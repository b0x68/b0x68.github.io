### LPIC-1 Exam Objective 103.2: Process Text Streams Using Filters

---

In this tutorial, we'll cover the essential UNIX commands for processing text streams using filters. These commands are foundational for working with text files and output streams in a UNIX/Linux environment, which is a crucial skill for the LPIC-1 certification exam.

### Key Commands and Their Usage

#### 1. `cat`

The `cat` command is used to concatenate and display the content of files.

**Example:**

```sh
# Display the content of a single file
cat file.txt

# Concatenate multiple files and display their combined content
cat file1.txt file2.txt
```

#### 2. `head`

The `head` command displays the first few lines of a file.

**Example:**

```sh
# Display the first 10 lines of a file
head file.txt

# Display the first 5 lines of a file
head -n 5 file.txt
```

#### 3. `tail`

The `tail` command displays the last few lines of a file.

**Example:**

```sh
# Display the last 10 lines of a file
tail file.txt

# Display the last 5 lines of a file
tail -n 5 file.txt
```

#### 4. `cut`

The `cut` command is used to extract specific sections from each line of a file.

**Example:**

```sh
# Extract the first field from each line, using a comma as the delimiter
cut -d ',' -f 1 file.csv

# Extract characters from positions 1 to 5
cut -c 1-5 file.txt
```

#### 5. `sort`

The `sort` command sorts lines of text files.

**Example:**

```sh
# Sort a file alphabetically
sort file.txt

# Sort a file numerically
sort -n numbers.txt
```

#### 6. `uniq`

The `uniq` command filters out repeated lines in a file.

**Example:**

```sh
# Remove duplicate lines from a sorted file
sort file.txt | uniq

# Count occurrences of unique lines
sort file.txt | uniq -c
```

#### 7. `tr`

The `tr` command translates or deletes characters.

**Example:**

```sh
# Translate lowercase to uppercase
echo "hello world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'

# Delete specific characters
echo "hello 123" | tr -d '0-9'
```

#### 8. `sed`

The `sed` command is a stream editor used to perform basic text transformations.

**Example:**

```sh
# Replace 'foo' with 'bar' in a file
sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt

# Delete lines containing 'pattern'
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
```

#### 9. `awk`

The `awk` command is a powerful programming language for pattern scanning and processing.

**Example:**

```sh
# Print the second column of a file
awk '{print $2}' file.txt

# Print lines where the third column is greater than 50
awk '$3 > 50' file.txt
```

#### 10. `grep`

The `grep` command searches for patterns in files.

**Example:**

```sh
# Search for 'pattern' in a file
grep 'pattern' file.txt

# Search recursively in all files under the current directory
grep -r 'pattern' .
```

### Compression and Checksum Commands

#### 11. `bzcat`, `xzcat`, `zcat`

These commands are used to view the contents of compressed files without decompressing them.

**Example:**

```sh
# View the content of a bzipped file
bzcat file.bz2

# View the content of an xzipped file
xzcat file.xz

# View the content of a gzipped file
zcat file.gz
```

#### 12. `md5sum`, `sha256sum`, `sha512sum`

These commands generate checksums for verifying file integrity.

**Example:**

```sh
# Generate an MD5 checksum
md5sum file.txt

# Generate a SHA-256 checksum
sha256sum file.txt

# Generate a SHA-512 checksum
sha512sum file.txt
```

### Other Useful Commands

#### 13. `nl`

The `nl` command numbers lines of files.

**Example:**

```sh
# Number the lines of a file
nl file.txt
```

#### 14. `od`

The `od` command displays files in various formats (octal, hexadecimal, etc.).

**Example:**

```sh
# Display the file in octal format
od -b file.txt

# Display the file in hexadecimal format
od -x file.txt
```

#### 15. `paste`

The `paste` command merges lines of files.

**Example:**

```sh
# Merge lines of two files
paste file1.txt file2.txt
```

#### 16. `split`

The `split` command splits files into pieces.

**Example:**

```sh
# Split a file into pieces of 1000 lines each
split -l 1000 file.txt part
```

#### 17. `wc`

The `wc` (word count) command displays the number of lines, words, and characters in a file.

**Example:**

```sh
# Display the number of lines, words, and characters
wc file.txt

# Display only the number of lines
wc -l file.txt

# Display only the number of words
wc -w file.txt
```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Extracting and Sorting Data

Let's say you have a CSV file `data.csv` with the following content:

```
name,age,department
Alice,30,HR
Bob,25,Engineering
Charlie,35,Marketing
Dave,28,HR
Eve,40,Engineering
```

**Task: Extract the names and sort them alphabetically.**

```sh
cut -d ',' -f 1 data.csv | sort
```

#### Example 2: Removing Duplicate Lines and Counting Occurrences

Suppose you have a file `access.log` with repeated IP addresses.

**Task: Remove duplicates and count occurrences.**

```sh
sort access.log | uniq -c
```

#### Example 3: Translating and Deleting Characters

Assume you have a text file `message.txt` with the content:

```
hello world 123
```

**Task: Translate lowercase to uppercase and delete numbers.**

```sh
cat message.txt | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' | tr -d '0-9'
```

### Conclusion

Mastering these commands will not only help you pass the LPIC-1 exam but also empower you to efficiently manage and process text files in a UNIX/Linux environment. Practice these commands with real-world examples to solidify your understanding and enhance your skills.
