## LPIC-1 Exam Objective 103.6: Modify Process Execution Priorities

### Weight: 2

### Description
Candidates should be able to manage process execution priorities.

### Key Knowledge Areas:
- Know the default priority of a job that is created.
- Run a program with higher or lower priority than the default.
- Change the priority of a running process.

### Files, Terms, and Utilities:
- `nice`
- `ps`
- `renice`
- `top`

### Introduction
In Linux, process execution priorities determine how much CPU time is allocated to each process. Understanding how to manage these priorities is crucial for optimizing system performance and ensuring that critical tasks receive the necessary resources. This tutorial will cover how to modify process execution priorities using tools such as `nice`, `renice`, `ps`, and `top` in both Ubuntu/Debian and Enterprise Linux distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and CentOS.

### Default Priority of a Job
When a process is created, it is assigned a default priority, which is typically 0. The priority range in Linux goes from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). 

#### Checking Default Priority
You can check the priority of running processes using the `ps` command:
```bash
ps -eo pid,ni,cmd | grep <process_name>
```
Here, `ni` represents the nice value of the process.

### Running a Program with Higher or Lower Priority
The `nice` command is used to start a process with a specified priority.

#### Syntax
```bash
nice -n <priority> <command>
```

#### Example
Starting a process with a lower priority:
```bash
nice -n 10 sleep 1000 &
```
This command starts the `sleep` process with a nice value of 10.

### Changing the Priority of a Running Process
The `renice` command is used to change the priority of an already running process.

#### Syntax
```bash
renice <priority> -p <pid>
```

#### Example
Changing the priority of a process with PID 1234 to -5:
```bash
sudo renice -5 -p 1234
```

### Using `top` to Monitor and Change Priorities
The `top` command is a powerful utility for monitoring system processes and their resource usage. It also allows you to change the priority of running processes.

#### Steps:
1. Run `top` by simply typing:
    ```bash
    top
    ```
2. Find the process you want to change.
3. Press `r` and enter the PID of the process.
4. Enter the new priority value.

### Practical Examples

#### Ubuntu/Debian Example
1. **Checking Current Priority:**
    ```bash
    ps -eo pid,ni,cmd | grep apache2
    ```

2. **Running a Program with Lower Priority:**
    ```bash
    nice -n 10 /usr/bin/myapp &
    ```

3. **Changing the Priority of a Running Process:**
    ```bash
    sudo renice -5 -p 1234
    ```

4. **Using `top` to Change Priority:**
    - Run `top`
    - Find the process (e.g., `myapp`)
    - Press `r` and enter the PID
    - Set the new priority (e.g., -10)

#### Enterprise Linux (RHEL/CentOS) Example
1. **Checking Current Priority:**
    ```bash
    ps -eo pid,ni,cmd | grep httpd
    ```

2. **Running a Program with Lower Priority:**
    ```bash
    nice -n 15 /usr/bin/myapp &
    ```

3. **Changing the Priority of a Running Process:**
    ```bash
    sudo renice -10 -p 5678
    ```

4. **Using `top` to Change Priority:**
    - Run `top`
    - Find the process (e.g., `myapp`)
    - Press `r` and enter the PID
    - Set the new priority (e.g., 5)

### Conclusion
Managing process execution priorities is a crucial skill for Linux system administrators. By using commands like `nice`, `renice`, `ps`, and `top`, you can ensure that critical processes receive the necessary resources and maintain optimal system performance. This knowledge is essential for the LPIC-1 certification and practical system administration tasks.
