## LPIC-1 Exam Objective 104.3: Control Mounting and Unmounting of Filesystems

In this tutorial, we'll cover how to control the mounting and unmounting of filesystems on Linux systems. We'll explore commands and configurations for both Ubuntu/Debian and Enterprise Linux (such as RHEL/CentOS) distributions, noting any differences between them.

### Key Knowledge Areas

1. Manually mount and unmount filesystems.
2. Configure filesystem mounting on bootup.
3. Configure user-mountable removable filesystems.
4. Use of labels and UUIDs for identifying and mounting filesystems.
5. Awareness of systemd mount units.

### Tools and Files

- `/etc/fstab`
- `/media/`
- `mount`
- `umount`
- `blkid`
- `lsblk`

### 1. Manually Mount and Unmount Filesystems

#### Mounting a Filesystem

The `mount` command is used to attach a filesystem to the filesystem hierarchy at a given mount point.

**Example:**

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
```

This mounts the device `/dev/sda1` to the directory `/mnt`.

#### Unmounting a Filesystem

The `umount` command is used to detach a filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy.

**Example:**

```bash
sudo umount /mnt
```

This unmounts the filesystem mounted at `/mnt`.

### 2. Configure Filesystem Mounting on Bootup

The `/etc/fstab` file contains information about filesystems and where they should be mounted. Entries in this file will be mounted at boot time.

**Example `/etc/fstab` entry:**

```plaintext
/dev/sda1 /mnt ext4 defaults 0 2
```

This line configures `/dev/sda1` to be mounted at `/mnt` using the `ext4` filesystem with default options.

### 3. Configure User-Mountable Removable Filesystems

To allow users to mount removable filesystems, entries can be added to `/etc/fstab` with the `user` option.

**Example `/etc/fstab` entry:**

```plaintext
/dev/sdb1 /media/usb vfat noauto,user 0 0
```

This line allows any user to mount the `/dev/sdb1` device to `/media/usb` using the `vfat` filesystem.

### 4. Use of Labels and UUIDs for Identifying and Mounting Filesystems

Using labels and UUIDs can be more reliable than device names, which can change between boots.

#### Finding UUIDs and Labels

The `blkid` command can be used to display UUIDs and labels of devices.

**Example:**

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sda1
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
/dev/sda1: UUID="e2e2e2e2-2e2e-2e2e-2e2e-2e2e2e2e2e2e" TYPE="ext4" LABEL="mydisk"
```

#### Using UUIDs and Labels in `/etc/fstab`

**Example using UUID:**

```plaintext
UUID=e2e2e2e2-2e2e-2e2e-2e2e-2e2e2e2e2e2e /mnt ext4 defaults 0 2
```

**Example using Label:**

```plaintext
LABEL=mydisk /mnt ext4 defaults 0 2
```

### 5. Awareness of systemd Mount Units

Systemd uses mount units to manage mount points. These units are automatically created from `/etc/fstab` entries, but they can also be manually created.

#### Example of a Manual Mount Unit

Create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Mount data

[Mount]
What=/dev/sda1
Where=/mnt/data
Type=ext4

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload the systemd manager configuration and start the mount unit:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start mnt-data.mount
sudo systemctl enable mnt-data.mount
```

### Commands and Utilities

#### `mount`

Used to mount filesystems.

**Syntax:**

```bash
mount [options] <device> <mount-point>
```

#### `umount`

Used to unmount filesystems.

**Syntax:**

```bash
umount [options] <mount-point|device>
```

#### `blkid`

Used to locate/print block device attributes.

**Syntax:**

```bash
blkid [options] <device>
```

#### `lsblk`

Used to list information about block devices.

**Syntax:**

```bash
lsblk [options] [device]
```

### Conclusion

This tutorial has covered the essentials for controlling the mounting and unmounting of filesystems in Linux, including practical examples and configurations for both Ubuntu/Debian and Enterprise Linux systems. Understanding these concepts and commands is crucial for effectively managing Linux filesystems, especially for the LPIC-1 certification exam.
