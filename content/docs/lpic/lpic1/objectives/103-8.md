## LPIC-1 Exam Objective: 103.8 Basic File Editing

### Introduction

Editing text files is a fundamental skill for any Linux system administrator. The LPIC-1 certification requires candidates to be proficient in using `vi`, a powerful and widely-used text editor. This tutorial will cover navigating documents using `vi`, understanding and using its modes, inserting, editing, deleting, copying, and finding text. We will also touch on other common editors like Emacs, nano, and vim, and how to set the default editor.

### Key Knowledge Areas

1. **Navigate a document using `vi`.**
2. **Understand and use `vi` modes.**
3. **Insert, edit, delete, copy and find text in `vi`.**
4. **Awareness of Emacs, nano, and vim.**
5. **Configure the standard editor.**

### vi Basics

`vi` is a modal editor, meaning it has different modes for different operations. The two primary modes are:

- **Normal Mode:** Used for navigation and manipulation of text.
- **Insert Mode:** Used for inserting text.

#### Starting `vi`

To start editing a file with `vi`, open a terminal and type:
```sh
vi filename
```
If the file does not exist, `vi` will create it.

#### Navigating in `vi`

In Normal Mode, you can navigate using the following keys:

- `h`: Move the cursor left.
- `j`: Move the cursor down.
- `k`: Move the cursor up.
- `l`: Move the cursor right.

You can also use arrow keys for navigation.

### Understanding `vi` Modes

- **Normal Mode:** Press `Esc` to enter Normal Mode.
- **Insert Mode:** Press `i` to enter Insert Mode at the cursor, `o` to open a new line below, or `a` to append after the cursor.

### Basic Editing Commands

#### Inserting Text

- `i`: Insert text at the cursor position.
- `o`: Open a new line below the cursor and enter Insert Mode.
- `a`: Append text after the cursor position.

#### Deleting Text

- `x`: Delete the character under the cursor.
- `dd`: Delete the entire line.

#### Copying and Pasting Text

- `yy`: Yank (copy) the entire line.
- `p`: Paste the yanked text after the cursor.

#### Finding Text

- `/pattern`: Search forward for `pattern`.
- `?pattern`: Search backward for `pattern`.

#### Saving and Quitting

- `:w`: Save the file.
- `:q`: Quit `vi`.
- `:wq` or `ZZ`: Save and quit.
- `:q!`: Quit without saving.

### Awareness of Other Editors

- **Emacs:** A highly customizable text editor with a large ecosystem of plugins.
- **nano:** A simple, easy-to-use text editor, ideal for beginners.
- **vim:** An enhanced version of `vi` with additional features and improvements.

### Configuring the Standard Editor

You can set the default editor by exporting the `EDITOR` environment variable. For example, to set `vim` as the default editor:
```sh
export EDITOR=vim
```

### Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Editing a Configuration File on Ubuntu/Debian

```sh
vi /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Navigate to the desired line using `j` or `k`, press `o` to open a new line, and add a new repository:
```
deb http://example.com/ubuntu focal main
```
Press `Esc` to return to Normal Mode, then `:wq` to save and exit.

#### Example 2: Editing a Log File on Enterprise Linux (RHEL/CentOS)

```sh
vi /var/log/messages
```

Search for a specific error message using:
```sh
/error
```
Navigate through the matches using `n` (next) and `N` (previous). To delete a line, move the cursor to the line and press `dd`. Save changes with `:w` and exit with `:q`.

### Conclusion

Mastering `vi` is essential for efficient text file editing in Linux. Understanding its modes and commands will significantly enhance your productivity. While `vi` is a powerful tool, being aware of other editors and knowing how to set the default editor ensures you are well-prepared for various scenarios in the Linux environment.
