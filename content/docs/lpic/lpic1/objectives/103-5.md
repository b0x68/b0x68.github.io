# LPIC-1 Exam Objective 103.5: Create, Monitor, and Kill Processes

## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll cover the essentials of process management in Linux. Weâ€™ll explore how to create, monitor, and kill processes, using real-world examples to distinguish between Ubuntu/Debian-based systems and Enterprise Linux (like CentOS and Red Hat).

### Key Knowledge Areas:

1. Run jobs in the foreground and background.
2. Signal a program to continue running after logout.
3. Monitor active processes.
4. Select and sort processes for display.
5. Send signals to processes.

### Relevant Commands and Utilities:

- `&`, `bg`, `fg`, `jobs`
- `kill`, `nohup`
- `ps`, `top`, `free`, `uptime`
- `pgrep`, `pkill`, `killall`
- `watch`, `screen`, `tmux`

## 1. Running Jobs in the Foreground and Background

### Foreground Jobs

By default, when you run a command in the terminal, it runs in the foreground. For example:

```bash
$ sleep 60
```

This command will run for 60 seconds and during this time, the terminal will be occupied with this process.

### Background Jobs

To run a process in the background, append an ampersand (`&`) to the command:

```bash
$ sleep 60 &
[1] 1234
```

The `[1]` is the job number, and `1234` is the process ID (PID). You can continue using the terminal while the command runs in the background.

### Bringing Jobs to Foreground and Background

- To list current jobs:
  
  ```bash
  $ jobs
  [1]+  Running                 sleep 60 &
  ```

- To bring a job to the foreground:

  ```bash
  $ fg %1
  ```

- To send a foreground job to the background, first suspend it using `Ctrl+Z`, then use:

  ```bash
  $ bg %1
  ```

## 2. Signaling a Program to Continue Running After Logout

The `nohup` (no hangup) command allows a process to continue running even after the user has logged out.

### Using `nohup`

```bash
$ nohup sleep 60 &
```

Output is redirected to `nohup.out` by default.

## 3. Monitoring Active Processes

### Using `ps`

The `ps` command is used to display information about active processes.

- To display processes for the current shell:

  ```bash
  $ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
   1234 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
   5678 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
  ```

- To display all processes:

  ```bash
  $ ps aux
  ```

- To filter processes using `grep`:

  ```bash
  $ ps aux | grep sleep
  ```

### Using `top`

The `top` command provides a dynamic real-time view of running processes.

```bash
$ top
```

Press `q` to quit.

### Using `htop`

`htop` is an interactive process viewer (not installed by default on some systems).

- To install on Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt-get install htop
  ```

- To install on Enterprise Linux:

  ```bash
  $ sudo yum install htop
  ```

Run it using:

```bash
$ htop
```

### Memory and System Load

- Check memory usage:

  ```bash
  $ free -h
  ```

- Check system uptime and load:

  ```bash
  $ uptime
  ```

## 4. Selecting and Sorting Processes for Display

### Using `ps` with Sorting Options

- Sort by memory usage:

  ```bash
  $ ps aux --sort=-%mem
  ```

- Sort by CPU usage:

  ```bash
  $ ps aux --sort=-%cpu
  ```

## 5. Sending Signals to Processes

### Using `kill`

The `kill` command sends signals to processes. The default signal is `TERM` (terminate).

- To send a `TERM` signal:

  ```bash
  $ kill 1234
  ```

- To send a `KILL` signal (force kill):

  ```bash
  $ kill -9 1234
  ```

### Using `pkill` and `pgrep`

- `pgrep` finds processes by name:

  ```bash
  $ pgrep sleep
  1234
  ```

- `pkill` kills processes by name:

  ```bash
  $ pkill sleep
  ```

### Using `killall`

The `killall` command kills all instances of a process by name:

```bash
$ killall sleep
```

## 6. Watching Commands

The `watch` command runs a program periodically, displaying the output in a full-screen interface.

```bash
$ watch -n 1 'ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10'
```

This runs the command every second and displays the top 10 memory-consuming processes.

## 7. Terminal Multiplexers: `screen` and `tmux`

### Using `screen`

`screen` allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions.

- Start a new session:

  ```bash
  $ screen
  ```

- Detach from the session with `Ctrl+A` followed by `D`.

- List sessions:

  ```bash
  $ screen -ls
  ```

- Reattach to a session:

  ```bash
  $ screen -r [session_id]
  ```

### Using `tmux`

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer similar to `screen`.

- Start a new session:

  ```bash
  $ tmux
  ```

- Detach from the session with `Ctrl+B` followed by `D`.

- List sessions:

  ```bash
  $ tmux ls
  ```

- Reattach to a session:

  ```bash
  $ tmux attach-session -t [session_id]
  ```

## Conclusion

Process management is a fundamental skill for any Linux administrator. By understanding how to create, monitor, and manage processes effectively, you can ensure your systems run smoothly and efficiently. This tutorial provides a solid foundation, but be sure to practice these commands to become proficient.
