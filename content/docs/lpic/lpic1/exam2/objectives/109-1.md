# Tech Tutorial: 109.1 Fundamentals of Internet

## Introduction

In the world of networking, a solid understanding of TCP/IP is crucial for any IT professional. TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is the backbone of the internet and is essential for any networked communication. In this tutorial, we will delve into the fundamentals of TCP/IP network fundamentals, ensuring that you have a thorough understanding of how networking works in a Linux environment.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understand the basics of TCP/IP
- Subnets and routing
- IPv4 and IPv6 differences
- Common network utilities

## Utilities

- `ifconfig`
- `ip`
- `netstat`
- `ss`
- `ping`
- `traceroute`
- `dig`
- `host`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding IP Addresses and Subnets

An IP address is a unique address used to identify a device on a network. IP addresses are part of the broader concept of subnets which help divide the network into manageable pieces.

#### Example: Viewing and Setting IP Addresses

- **Viewing IP Configuration with `ifconfig`:**

```bash
ifconfig
```

- **Setting an IP Address with `ifconfig`:**

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

- **Using `ip` command:**

```bash
ip addr show
```

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
```

### 2. Routing and Basic Network Configuration

Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic.

#### Example: Viewing and Adding Routes

- **View routes with `ip`:**

```bash
ip route show
```

- **Add a new route:**

```bash
sudo ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
```

### 3. Using Network Utilities

These utilities help you diagnose and configure network settings.

#### `ping` - Check Connectivity

```bash
ping google.com
```

#### `traceroute` - Trace Route to a Host

```bash
traceroute google.com
```

#### `netstat` - Network Statistics

```bash
netstat -ant
```

#### `ss` - Socket Statistics

```bash
ss -tulwn
```

#### `dig` - DNS Lookup

```bash
dig google.com
```

#### `host` - DNS Lookup

```bash
host google.com
```

### 4. IPv4 vs IPv6

Understanding the differences between IPv4 and IPv6 is crucial as the internet transitions more towards IPv6 due to IPv4 address exhaustion.

#### Example: Displaying IPv6 Configuration

- **Using `ifconfig`:**

```bash
ifconfig eth0 inet6
```

- **Using `ip`:**

```bash
ip -6 addr show
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the fundamental concepts of TCP/IP networking is essential for troubleshooting and managing networked systems. This guide has covered how to use various network utilities to monitor and configure networks. Mastery of these tools and concepts will enhance your ability to manage both small and large scale network environments effectively.

Ensure to practice these commands and utilize them in real network settings to get a hands-on understanding of how TCP/IP networking functions.
