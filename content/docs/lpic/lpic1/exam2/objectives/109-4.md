# Tech Tutorial: 109.4 Configure client-side DNS

## Introduction

DNS (Domain Name System) is crucial in the networking realm as it translates human-memorable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses that networking equipment need for routing packets. Configuring DNS properly on a client host is essential for efficient network communication and resource access. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to configure DNS on a Linux client system.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understand the `/etc/resolv.conf` file
- Use of `systemd-resolved`
- Configure DNS with NetworkManager
- Test DNS configuration

## Utilities

- `resolvconf`
- `nmcli`
- `systemd-resolve`
- `dig`
- `nslookup`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding `/etc/resolv.conf`

Before diving into configuration, it's important to understand the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. This file is used by the resolver library to determine the DNS servers that the system uses for name resolution. Here is a typical example:

```bash
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 8.8.8.8
search example.com
```

Each `nameserver` line specifies a DNS server to use. The `search` line is used to set the domain search list.

### 2. Using `resolvconf` to Manage DNS Information

`resolvconf` is a utility on some Linux distributions to manage `/etc/resolv.conf`. When installed, you should avoid editing `/etc/resolv.conf` directly, as `resolvconf` will overwrite your changes. Here's how to add a new DNS server:

```bash
echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" | sudo resolvconf -a eth0.inet
```

To view the current DNS configurations managed by `resolvconf`:

```bash
resolvconf --show
```

### 3. Configure DNS using `systemd-resolved`

On systems using `systemd-networkd`, DNS resolution is often handled by `systemd-resolved`. To use this service, you can link `/etc/resolv.conf` to the `systemd-resolved` managed symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

To add or change the DNS servers:

```bash
sudo systemd-resolve --set-dns=9.9.9.9 --interface=eth0
sudo systemd-resolve --set-dns=149.112.112.112 --interface=eth0
```

To verify DNS configuration:

```bash
systemd-resolve --status
```

### 4. Configuring DNS with NetworkManager

For systems using NetworkManager, you can configure DNS settings using the `nmcli` tool:

```bash
nmcli con modify "Connection Name" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
nmcli con up "Connection Name"
```

To see current DNS settings managed by NetworkManager:

```bash
nmcli dev show | grep DNS
```

### 5. Testing DNS Configuration

**Using `dig`:**

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
```

**Using `nslookup`:**

```bash
nslookup www.google.com 8.8.8.8
```

These commands test DNS resolution explicitly using the server `8.8.8.8`.

## Conclusion

Properly configuring DNS on a Linux client helps ensure that network operations involving domain name resolution function efficiently and reliably. By mastering tools like `resolvconf`, `nmcli`, and `systemd-resolve`, and understanding the configuration files involved, you can effectively manage DNS settings in various Linux environments. Remember to test your configuration to ensure that DNS resolution is working as expected.
