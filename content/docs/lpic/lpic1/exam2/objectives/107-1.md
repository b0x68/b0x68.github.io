## Introduction
Linux is a multi-user system where managing users and groups is a fundamental aspect of system administration. This tutorial covers essential commands and procedures for managing user and group accounts on a Linux system. By the end, you will learn how to add, remove, suspend, and modify user accounts, along with managing group memberships.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- User and group commands
- System files used to manage users and groups

## Utilities:
- `useradd`
- `usermod`
- `userdel`
- `groupadd`
- `groupmod`
- `groupdel`
- `passwd`
- `chage`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Adding User Accounts
The `useradd` command is used to create a new user account on a Linux system.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Add a new user with the default settings
sudo useradd johndoe

# Add a new user with a specific home directory and default shell
sudo useradd -d /home/johndoe -s /bin/bash johndoe
```

### 2. Modifying User Accounts
To modify details of an existing user account, use the `usermod` command.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Change the user's login name
sudo usermod -l johndoe_new johndoe

# Add a user to a supplementary group
sudo usermod -aG sudo johndoe
```

### 3. Deleting User Accounts
Use the `userdel` command to remove a user account from the system.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Delete a user account
sudo userdel johndoe

# Delete a user account and their home directory
sudo userdel -r johndoe
```

### 4. Managing Passwords
The `passwd` command is used to update a user's password.

#### Code Example:
```bash

# Unlock a user's password
sudo passwd -u johndoe
```

### 5. Changing User Account Expiry
The `chage` command is used to change the user password expiry information.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Set password expiry information for a user
sudo chage -E 2023-12-31 johndoe

# List password and account aging information
sudo chage -l johndoe
```

### 6. Adding Groups
The `groupadd` command allows you to create a new group.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Add a new group
sudo groupadd developers
```

### 7. Modifying Groups

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Rename a group
sudo groupmod -n newdevelopers developers
```

### 8. Deleting Groups
The `groupdel` command is used to delete a group.

#### Code Example:
```bash
# Delete a group
sudo groupdel developers
```
