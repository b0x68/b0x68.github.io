# Tech Tutorial: 110.1 Perform Security Administration

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the critical aspect of security administration on Linux systems. Ensuring the security of a Linux host is paramount, especially in environments sensitive to data breaches or intrusions. This guide will help you understand how to review and secure your Linux systems in alignment with local security policies.

## Exam Objective

The goal is to equip candidates with the knowledge required to review system configurations and ensure host security effectively. This includes understanding various utilities and commands that assist in monitoring and securing a system.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Auditing system files
- Managing user/group permissions and ownership
- Understanding of security-related system logs
- Basics of firewall management

## Utilities

- `auditd`
- `chown`, `chmod`
- `journalctl`
- `firewalld`, `iptables`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Auditing System Files with `auditd`

`auditd` is a daemon that serves the purpose of creating an audit trail, which is a record of who did what and when on the system. It's a key component in system security and complying with local security policies.

**Installation**

```bash
sudo apt-get install auditd    # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install audit        # CentOS/RHEL
```

**Configuring Audit Rules**

You can configure audit rules by editing the `/etc/audit/audit.rules` file. Here's an example to audit all attempts to alter the system time:

```bash
echo '-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S adjtimex -S settimeofday -k time-change' | sudo tee -a /etc/audit/audit.rules
sudo systemctl restart auditd
```

**Checking Audit Logs**

Audit logs can be reviewed using the `ausearch` or `aureport` utilities:

```bash
sudo ausearch -k time-change
sudo aureport -m
```

### 2. Managing Permissions with `chown` and `chmod`

Proper file permissions and ownership are crucial for securing access to system files and directories.

**Changing Ownership with `chown`:**

```bash
sudo chown username:groupname filename
```

**Setting Permissions with `chmod`:**

```bash
sudo chmod 644 filename
```

Here, `644` sets read and write permissions for the owner, and read-only for the group and others.

### 3. System Logs with `journalctl`

`journalctl` is part of the `systemd` suite and is used to query and display messages from the systemd journal.

**Viewing Logs:**

```bash
journalctl
```

**Filtering Logs by Time:**

```bash
journalctl --since "2021-01-01" --until "2021-01-02"
```

### 4. Basic Firewall Management with `firewalld` and `iptables`

Firewalls are critical in defending a system from unwanted access.

**Using `firewalld`:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

**Using `iptables`:**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

## Conclusion

Security administration is a continuous process of monitoring, auditing, and adjusting based on evolving threats and compliance requirements. This tutorial covers the basics and provides a foundation for securing your Linux systems. Regularly review your security policies and ensure your system configurations adhere to these standards. Always test changes in a safe environment before applying them to production systems.
