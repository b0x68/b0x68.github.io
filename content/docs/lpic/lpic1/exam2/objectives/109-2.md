# Tech Tutorial: 109.2 Persistent Network Configuration

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to manage the persistent network configuration of a Linux host. Network configuration is critical in ensuring that your Linux systems are connected and functioning properly in a networked environment. Understanding how to configure network settings that persist across reboots is essential for system administrators.

We will cover the necessary utilities and commands needed to configure and manage the network interfaces persistently. By the end of this guide, you should have a solid understanding of how to handle network configurations on a Linux system.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understanding network configuration files
- Using command-line tools to manage network settings
- Services and daemons for network configuration
- Techniques for troubleshooting network issues

## Utilities:

- `ifconfig`
- `ip`
- `netplan`
- `nmcli`
- `systemd-networkd`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configuring Network Using ifconfig

The `ifconfig` utility is one of the most common tools used for network interface configuration. It is part of the `net-tools` package.

#### **Example:**

To display all interfaces, which might be in use or not:

```bash
ifconfig -a
```

To configure an IP address on an interface:

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

To disable an interface:

```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 down
```

### 2. Using the `ip` Command

The `ip` command is part of the `iproute2` package and is used to show and manipulate routing, network devices, interfaces, and tunnels.

#### **Examples:**

To display all interfaces:

```bash
ip link show
```

To set an IP address:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

To bring an interface up:

```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

To bring an interface down:

```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 down
```

### 3. Managing Network with Netplan

Netplan is a utility for easily configuring networking on a linux system. You simply create a YAML description of the required network interfaces and what each should be configured to do.

#### **Configuration Example:**

Create or edit a file in `/etc/netplan/` (e.g., `01-netcfg.yaml`):

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

### 4. Using `nmcli` for Network Management

`nmcli` is a command-line client for NetworkManager. It allows querying and configuring network connections and interfaces.

#### **Examples:**

To show all connections:

```bash
nmcli con show
```

To add a new Ethernet connection:

```bash
nmcli con add con-name "static-eth0" ifname eth0 type ethernet ip4 192.168.1.100/24 gw4 192.168.1.1
```

To bring up a connection:

```bash
nmcli con up id "static-eth0"
```

### 5. Configuring Networks with `systemd-networkd`

`systemd-networkd` is a system daemon that manages network configurations.

#### **Example Configuration File (`/etc/systemd/network/10-static-eth0.network`):**

```ini
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Address=192.168.1.100/24
Gateway=192.168.1.1
DNS=8.8.8.8
```

To restart `systemd-networkd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned about several tools and configurations that can be used to manage persistent network settings on Linux. Whether you're using `ifconfig`, `ip`, `netplan`, `nmcli`, or `systemd-networkd`, each tool has its specific use cases and benefits. Understanding these tools will help you effectively manage network configurations in a persistent manner across system reboots, ensuring your networked systems stay connected as needed.
