# Tech Tutorial: 108.2 System Logging with rsyslog and systemd-journald

## Introduction
In the Linux ecosystem, logging is a critical aspect of monitoring and managing systems, especially in a networked environment. This tutorial will delve into configuring `rsyslog`, handling logs with `systemd-journald`, and provide an overview of `syslog` and `syslog-ng` as alternative logging systems. Understanding how to configure a logging daemon to send log output to a central log server or to act as a central log server is essential for effective system administration.

## Key Knowledge Areas
- Configuration of rsyslog
- Use and operation of systemd-journald
- Basic awareness of syslog and syslog-ng alternatives
- Centralized and local logging

## Utilities
- rsyslogd
- journalctl
- logger

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configuring rsyslog

#### Basic Configuration
`rsyslog` is a rocket-fast system for log processing; it can deliver over a million messages per second to local destinations. To configure `rsyslog`, you typically modify the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file and files in the `/etc/rsyslog.d/` directory.

**Example:** Basic `rsyslog.conf` setup
```bash
# Use default template
module(load="imuxsock") # provides support for local system logging
module(load="imklog")   # provides kernel logging support

# provides UDP syslog reception
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")

# provides TCP syslog reception
module(load="imtcp")
input(type="imtcp" port="514")

# Template for storing logs
template(name="FileFormat" type="string" string="/var/log/%HOSTNAME%/%PROGRAMNAME%.log")

# Log messages to specific files based on the program
if $programname == 'apache' then {
    action(type="omfile" dynaFile="FileFormat")
    stop
}
```

#### Sending Logs to a Central Server
To configure `rsyslog` to send logs to a remote server, you can use the `*.* @@remote-host:514` syntax where `*.*` represents all facilities and priorities.

**Example:** Forwarding all logs to a central log server
```bash
*.* @@192.168.1.100:514
```

### 2. Configuring systemd-journald

`systemd-journald` is a service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that it receives.

#### Viewing Logs with journalctl
`journalctl` is the tool used to query and display the logs from `systemd-journald`.

**Example:** Display all logs
```bash
journalctl
```

**Example:** Show logs from a specific service
```bash
journalctl -u nginx.service
```

**Example:** Show logs since the last boot
```bash
journalctl -b
```

**Example:** Filtering logs by priority
```bash
journalctl -p err -b
```

#### Forwarding journald logs to rsyslog
To forward logs from `journald` to `rsyslog`, you can modify the `/etc/systemd/journald.conf` file by setting the `ForwardToSyslog=yes`.

**Example:** journald.conf modification
```ini
[Journal]
Storage=persistent
ForwardToSyslog=yes
```

### 3. Awareness of syslog and syslog-ng

While `rsyslog` is commonly used, `syslog` and `syslog-ng` are also popular logging systems. `syslog-ng` offers advanced filtering, classification, and rewriting capabilities.

**Example:** Basic `syslog-ng` configuration to forward logs
```bash
source s_local {
    system();
    internal();
};

destination d_remote {
    tcp("192.168.1.100" port(514));
};

log {
    source(s_local);
    destination(d_remote);
};
```

## Conclusion
Understanding and configuring system logging are crucial for maintaining the health and security of a server environment. In this tutorial, we covered configuring `rsyslog` for local and remote logging, handling logs with `systemd-journald`, and introduced `syslog` and `syslog-ng` as alternative systems. Effective logging setup helps in troubleshooting and ensuring that critical events are not missed in a networked environment.
