# Tech Tutorial: 105.1 Customize and Use the Shell Environment

## Introduction

In the world of Linux, the shell acts as the intermediary between the user and the operating system, handling commands and executing programs. Being able to customize the shell environment is essential for enhancing productivity and tailoring the experience to individual needs, whether for personal use or for maintaining user environments in a multi-user system.

This tutorial will cover the necessary skills to customize various shell environments and will walk you through how to modify both global and user-specific profiles. Understanding these concepts will allow you to set up environments that can significantly improve your command line efficiency.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding the various configuration files for bash and other shells
- Setting environment variables
- Altering shell behavior using profile scripts
- Writing session and login scripts

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Configuration Files

Shells like Bash read configuration files that define the environment settings. These files include, but are not limited to:

- `/etc/profile`: A global configuration script that applies settings system-wide. Every user under the Bash shell executes this script at login.
- `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bash_login`, and `~/.profile`: User-specific scripts that configure the environment when the user logs in. `~/.bash_profile` is read first, and if it's not found, Bash looks for `~/.bash_login`, and then `~/.profile`.
- `~/.bashrc`: Specific to the Bash shell, this file is executed for interactive non-login shells.

#### Example: Setting PATH globally and locally

**Global setting (/etc/profile):**

```bash
# Add /usr/local/bin to the PATH for all users
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> /etc/profile
```

**Local user setting (~/.bashrc):**

```bash
# Add ~/bin to the user's PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 2. Setting Environment Variables

Environment variables are key-value pairs stored within the system that can be used by shell processes. Here's how to set them:

**Setting a temporary variable:**

```bash
# Set a temporary environment variable
export MY_VAR="Hello World"
```

**Making it permanent by adding to the profile script:**

```bash
# Add variable to ~/.bashrc for it to persist
echo 'export MY_VAR="Hello World"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 3. Altering Shell Behavior Using Profile Scripts

You can customize shell behaviors such as command aliases, functions, and other settings via profile scripts.

#### Example: Creating an alias

```bash
# Add an alias to make updates easier
echo 'alias update="sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### 4. Writing Session and Login Scripts

Session and login scripts are crucial for setting up environments when users log in or open a new shell.

**Example session script:**

```bash
# ~/.bash_login
echo "Welcome, $USER! Today is $(date)."
```

**Example login script:**

```bash
# ~/.bash_profile
echo 'Setting up your environment...'
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Conclusion

Customizing your shell environment can streamline your workflow and make your interactions with the Linux system more efficient and pleasurable. By mastering the use of configuration files and environment variables, you can ensure that your system behaves exactly how you need it to, whether you're managing a single user account or configuring environments for multiple users. With these skills, you'll be able to harness the full power of the Linux command line to suit your needs.

This tutorial has covered the essential aspects of customizing and using the shell as outlined in the exam objective 105.1. By understanding and making use of the information provided, you're well on your way to becoming proficient in managing Linux environments.
