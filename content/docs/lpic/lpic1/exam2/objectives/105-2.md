# Tech Tutorial: 105.2 Customize or write simple Bash scripts

## Introduction
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a powerful shell and scripting language used extensively in the Linux environment. It offers extensive capabilities to automate tasks, manipulate files, and manage system operations. This tutorial aims to provide an understanding of how to customize existing scripts and write simple new Bash scripts, a critical skill for any Linux system administrator or developer.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Basic Bash scripting syntax
- Using variables and loops
- Conditional statements
- Input and output handling
- Common text processing utilities

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Basic Bash Scripting Syntax
Every Bash script starts with a shebang (`#!`) followed by the path to the Bash interpreter:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

This script outputs `Hello, World!`. The `echo` command is used for displaying lines of text or variables.

### 2. Using Variables and Loops

#### Variables
In Bash, you can create variables to store data such as strings, numbers, or the output of a command.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
greeting="Welcome"
user=$(whoami)
echo "$greeting, $user!"
```

This script stores a greeting message in a variable and retrieves the current user's name, outputting a personalized welcome message.

#### Loops
Loops allow you to execute commands repeatedly. Here's an example using a `for` loop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for number in {1..5}
do
  echo "Iteration $number"
done
```

This loop will print "Iteration" followed by the numbers 1 through 5.

### 3. Conditional Statements

You can make decisions in your scripts with `if`, `else`, and `elif`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
if [[ $num -gt 10 ]]
then
  echo "The number is greater than 10."
elif [[ $num -eq 10 ]]
then
  echo "The number is equal to 10."
else
  echo "The number is less than 10."
fi
```

This script prompts the user to enter a number and displays a message based on the number entered.

### 4. Input and Output Handling

Handling user input and file output is crucial for interactive scripts.

#### Reading User Input
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

#### Redirecting Output to a File
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Logging you in..."
date > login.txt
echo "Login date recorded in login.txt"
```

This script writes the current date to `login.txt`.

### 5. Common Text Processing Utilities

Bash has several utilities for text processing:

#### `grep`
Searches for patterns in text.
```bash
echo -e "apple\nbanana\ncarrot" | grep "banana"
```

#### `awk`
Pattern scanning and processing language.
```bash
echo -e "John Doe 5000\nJane Doe 6000" | awk '{print $1 " earns " $3}'
```

#### `sed`
Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
```bash
echo "Welcome to Linux" | sed 's/Linux/UNIX/'
```

## Detailed Code Examples

- **Using `grep` to Filter Log Entries:**

```bash
cat /var/log/system.log | grep "ERROR"
```

- **Generating Reports with `awk`:**

```bash
cat sales.txt | awk '{total += $3} END {print "Total sales: " total}'
```

- **Modifying Configuration Files with `sed`:**

```bash
sed -i 's/localhost/127.0.0.1/g' /etc/hosts
```

## Conclusion

Bash scripting is an essential skill for automating tasks in a Linux environment. By understanding how to customize and write simple scripts, you can significantly enhance your productivity and system management capabilities. Practice regularly and explore more complex scripts to deepen your expertise.
