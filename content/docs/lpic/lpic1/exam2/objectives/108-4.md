# Tech Tutorial: 108.4 Manage printers and printing jobs

## Introduction

In the realm of Linux system administration, managing printers and their respective print jobs is a critical skill. This tutorial will focus on utilizing the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) along with the legacy Line Printer Daemon (LPD) compatibility interface to handle print queues and user print jobs effectively. Understanding these tools will enable you to configure and manage printers on a Linux system efficiently.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Managing printers with CUPS
- Handling print queues
- Cancelling and reordering print jobs
- LPD compatibility interface

## Utilities:
- `lpadmin`
- `lpstat`
- `lp`
- `lprm`
- `lpq`
- `lpc`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Managing Printers with CUPS

#### 1.1 Adding a Printer
To add a printer using the `lpadmin` command, you need to specify the printer name, connection protocol, and device URI. Hereâ€™s a basic example of adding a network printer:

```bash
lpadmin -p Printer_Name -E -v socket://192.168.1.5:9100
```

In this command:
- `-p` specifies the printer name.
- `-E` enables the printer and accepts jobs.
- `-v` defines the device URI.

#### 1.2 Removing a Printer
To remove a printer, use `lpadmin` with the `-x` option:

```bash
lpadmin -x Printer_Name
```

### 2. Managing Print Queues and Jobs

#### 2.1 Checking Printer Status
The `lpstat` command is used to get the status of printers and print jobs. To check the status of all printers:

```bash
lpstat -p
```

#### 2.2 Printing a File
To print a document, use the `lp` command:

```bash
lp -d Printer_Name document.txt
```

- `-d` specifies the printer name.

#### 2.3 Cancelling a Print Job
To cancel a print job, first find the job ID using `lpstat`, then use `lprm`:

```bash
lpstat -o
lprm Job_ID
```

### 3. LPD Compatibility Interface

#### 3.1 Using `lpq` to View Queue
The `lpq` command checks the content of the print queue:

```bash
lpq -P Printer_Name
```

#### 3.2 Using `lpc` for Control
The `lpc` command provides limited control over printer spools. To check the status of a printer:

```bash
lpc status Printer_Name
```

### Detailed Code Examples

#### Example: Adding Multiple Printers
```bash
lpadmin -p Office_Printer -E -v ipp://office-printer.local
lpadmin -p HR_Printer -E -v dnssd://HR-Printer._ipp._tcp.local
```

#### Example: Printing Multiple Files
```bash
lp -d Office_Printer report.pdf
lp -d HR_Printer memo.docx
```

#### Example: Managing Print Jobs
```bash
lpstat -t  # Shows all printers and jobs
lprm -P HR_Printer 1023  # Cancel job ID 1023 on HR_Printer
```

#### Example: Checking and Clearing Queues
```bash
lpq -P Office_Printer
lpc stop Office_Printer
lpc start Office_Printer
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the essential aspects of managing printers and print jobs on Linux using CUPS and the LPD compatibility interface. By mastering these commands, you can effectively manage printing operations within a Linux environment, ensuring smooth and efficient handling of print resources. Whether adding new printers, managing queues, or cancelling jobs, these tools provide the control necessary for comprehensive print management.

Remember, consistent practice and exploration of these commands in different scenarios will deepen your understanding and proficiency in managing Linux-based printing services.
