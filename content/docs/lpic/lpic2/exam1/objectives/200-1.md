# Tech Tutorial: 200.1 Measure and Troubleshoot Resource Usage

## Introduction

In system administration, it's crucial to understand how resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network are utilized and how they can be monitored effectively. A deep understanding of resource usage helps in optimizing performance and troubleshooting issues that may arise in a Linux environment. This tutorial aims to equip candidates with the knowledge and tools to measure hardware resource and network bandwidth, and identify and troubleshoot resource problems.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understanding of system resources
- Tools to monitor system resources
- Identifying high resource usage
- Troubleshooting resource issues

## Utilities

- `top`
- `vmstat`
- `iostat`
- `iotop`
- `free`
- `uptime`
- `ps`
- `mpstat`
- `pidstat`
- `tload`
- `netstat`
- `ifstat`

## Step-by-Step Guide

In this section, we will explore each utility, providing detailed examples and explanations of their use in monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 1. Monitoring with `top`

The `top` command provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information and a list of processes or threads currently being managed by the Linux kernel.

```bash
top
```

#### Key Metrics:
- **PID**: Process ID.
- **USER**: User name of the process owner.
- **PR**: Priority of the task.
- **NI**: The nice value of the task.
- **VIRT**: Virtual memory used by the process.
- **RES**: Resident memory used by the process.
- **SHR**: Shared memory of the process.
- **S**: Status of the process (sleeping, running, stopped, etc).
- **%CPU**: The percentage of the CPU used by the process.
- **%MEM**: The percentage of RAM used by the process.

### 2. Using `vmstat`

`vmstat` reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and cpu activity.

```bash
vmstat 1 5
```
This command will display system information every 1 second for 5 intervals.

#### Key Outputs:
- **procs.r**: Number of processes waiting for run time.
- **procs.b**: Number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.
- **memory.swpd**: Used virtual memory.
- **memory.free**: Idle memory.
- **cpu.us**: Time spent running non-kernel code.

### 3. Disk I/O with `iostat`

`iostat` is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates.

```bash
iostat -xz 1 5
```
This will provide detailed disk statistics every second, repeated five times.

#### Key Outputs:
- **%util**: Percentage of CPU time during which I/O requests were issued to the device.
- **r/s**: Read requests per second.
- **w/s**: Write requests per second.

### 4. Real-time I/O with `iotop`

`iotop` monitors disk I/O usage information output by the kernel and displays a table of current I/O usage by processes.

```bash
sudo iotop -o
```

### 5. Checking Memory with `free`

`free` displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system.

```bash
free -h
```

### 6. System Uptime with `uptime`

`uptime` shows how long the system has been running.

```bash
uptime
```

### 7. Process Details with `ps`

`ps` provides a snapshot of the current processes.

```bash
ps aux
```

### 8. CPU Performance with `mpstat`

`mpstat` displays CPU statistics.

```bash
mpstat -P ALL 1 5
```

### 9. Detailed Process Statistics with `pidstat`

`pidstat` is used for monitoring individual tasks in real-time.

```bash
pidstat 1 5
```

### 10. Terminal Load Average with `tload`

`tload` prints a graphical representation of system load average to the terminal.

```bash
tload
```

### 11. Network Connections with `netstat`

`netstat` prints network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

```bash
netstat -tulnp
```

### 12. Interface Statistics with `ifstat`

`ifstat` reports network interface statistics.

```bash
ifstat 1 5
```

## Conclusion

Monitoring and troubleshooting are integral parts of managing a Linux system effectively. By mastering the utilities discussed, candidates can ensure systems run efficiently and are able to quickly identify and resolve issues related to resource usage. Regular practice with these tools will help in developing a deeper understanding of system behaviors and performance management.
