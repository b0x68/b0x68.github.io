# Tech Tutorial: 202.3 Alternate Bootloaders

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore alternate bootloaders beyond the commonly used GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader). A bootloader is fundamental in the process of booting up your Linux system as it manages and allows the loading of the operating system kernel. Understanding alternate bootloaders is crucial for system recovery, customization, and optimization.

## Exam Objective

The objective covers the understanding and application of alternate bootloaders, with a specific focus on LILO (Linux Loader) and SYSLINUX. These bootloaders serve as alternatives to GRUB and are used in various scenarios depending on system requirements and constraints.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- LILO configuration
- SYSLINUX configuration
- PXELINUX for network boot

## Utilities:
- `lilo`
- `syslinux`
- `pxelinux`
- `isolinux`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. LILO (Linux Loader)

LILO is one of the oldest bootloaders used in Linux systems. Unlike GRUB, LILO does not support booting from a network and must be reinstalled each time you change the configuration file.

#### LILO Configuration

Here's how you can install and configure LILO on a typical Linux system.

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lilo
```

**Configuration:**

Edit the `/etc/lilo.conf` file to set up the boot options.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/lilo.conf
```

**Sample `lilo.conf`:**

```plaintext
boot=/dev/sda
vga=normal
read-only

image=/boot/vmlinuz
  label=linux
  initrd=/boot/initrd.img
  read-only
```

**Updating LILO:**

Every time you make changes to `lilo.conf`, you need to update LILO.

```bash
sudo lilo
```

This command will integrate the changes into the bootloader.

### 2. SYSLINUX

SYSLINUX is a suite of lightweight bootloaders, designed for simplicity and compatibility, which includes PXELINUX for network boot scenarios.

#### SYSLINUX Configuration

**Installation:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install syslinux
```

**Configuration:**

Copy the SYSLINUX files to your target directory (usually a USB drive or a specific partition).

```bash
sudo syslinux /dev/sdb1
```

**Creating a config file (`syslinux.cfg`):**

```bash
mkdir /mnt/usb
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
nano /mnt/usb/syslinux.cfg
```

**Sample `syslinux.cfg`:**

```plaintext
DEFAULT linux
LABEL linux
    KERNEL vmlinuz
    APPEND root=/dev/sdb1 ro quiet
```

Unmount the USB drive:

```bash
umount /mnt/usb
```

### 3. PXELINUX

PXELINUX is part of the SYSLINUX suite, designed for booting from a network.

**Setting up a PXELINUX boot server:**

Install necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install tftp-hpa inetutils-inetd
```

Configure `tftp` and place the PXELINUX bootloader and kernel files in the tftp directory.

**`/etc/inetd.conf` entry for tftp:**

```plaintext
tftp    dgram   udp     wait    nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/in.tftpd /tftpboot
```

**Sample PXELINUX configuration (`pxelinux.cfg/default`):**

```plaintext
DEFAULT linux
LABEL linux
    KERNEL vmlinuz
    APPEND root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=192.168.0.1:/path/to/rootfs ip=dhcp rw
```

Restart the inetd service:

```bash
sudo service inetd restart
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and configuring alternate bootloaders like LILO, SYSLINUX, and PXELINUX can be crucial for customizing your boot process, especially in environments where specific configurations or network booting is required. These tools offer flexibility and a range of options for different scenarios, making them valuable additions to any system administrator's toolkit.
