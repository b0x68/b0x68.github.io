# Tech Tutorial: 204.2 Adjusting Storage Device Access

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into adjusting storage device access in a Linux environment, a crucial skill set for system administrators. This objective focuses on understanding and managing how storage devices are accessed and controlled, ensuring data integrity and optimal performance.

## Exam Objective

- Adjusting storage device access

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understanding and managing device files
- Configuring udev for persistent device naming
- Understanding and configuring filesystem mount options

## Utilities

- `lsblk`
- `blkid`
- `udisksctl`
- `mount`
- `umount`
- `fstab`
- `udevadm`
- `tune2fs`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Device Files

Linux uses device files to represent hardware devices. These files are usually located in the `/dev` directory.

#### Detailed Code Example

To view block devices and their information:

```bash
lsblk
```

Output might look like:

```
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   100G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0    96G  0 part /
└─sda2   8:2    0     4G  0 part [SWAP]
```

### 2. Configuring udev for Persistent Device Naming

`udev` is the device manager for the Linux kernel that manages device nodes in `/dev`.

#### Detailed Code Example

To analyze current udev rules and device attributes:

```bash
udevadm info --query=all --name=/dev/sda
```

To create a custom udev rule for persistent naming:

```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTRS{model}=="Samsung SSD 850", SYMLINK+="mydisk"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-custom.rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

This creates a symlink `/dev/mydisk` that points to the device `/dev/sda`, identified by its model.

### 3. Understanding and Configuring Filesystem Mount Options

Filesystem mount options determine how filesystems are mounted and interacted with.

#### Detailed Code Example

To view the UUID of a device for use in `fstab`:

```bash
blkid /dev/sda1
```

Output might look like:

```
/dev/sda1: UUID="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000" TYPE="ext4"
```

To edit `/etc/fstab` to include auto-mount at boot with specific options:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add the line:

```
UUID=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000 /mnt/data ext4 defaults,noatime 0 2
```

### 4. Managing Mounts and Unmounts

Using `mount` and `umount` to manually mount and unmount filesystems.

#### Detailed Code Example

To mount a filesystem manually:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/data
```

To unmount:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/data
```

### 5. udisksctl: Managing Disks

`udisksctl` is a utility for interacting with storage devices.

#### Detailed Code Example

To mount a device using `udisksctl`:

```bash
udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sda1
```

Output might look like:

```
Mounted /dev/sda1 at /media/user/NewVolume.
```

### 6. Tuning Filesystems with `tune2fs`

`tune2fs` is used to adjust various tunable filesystem parameters on Linux ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystems.

#### Detailed Code Example

To enable journaling on an ext4 filesystem:

```bash
sudo tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sda1
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered how to adjust storage device access, including managing device files, configuring persistent device naming with udev, understanding and setting mount options, and using tools like `udisksctl` and `tune2fs` for disk management. Mastery of these skills ensures efficient and secure management of storage devices in a Linux environment, essential for system administrators and IT professionals.
