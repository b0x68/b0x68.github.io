# Tech Tutorial: 204.3 Logical Volume Manager (LVM)

## Introduction

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a flexible and advanced option in Linux for disk management. It allows for the resizing of disks, the creation of snapshots, and the combining of multiple physical disks into a single logical volume. LVM is particularly useful in environments where disk space requirements are constantly changing. This tutorial will guide you through the essentials of managing logical volumes using LVM on a Linux system.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Create and manage physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes
- Extend logical volumes
- Resize logical volumes
- Use LVM snapshots
- Recover physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes

## Utilities

- `pvcreate`, `pvremove`, `pvchange`, `pvscan`
- `vgcreate`, `vgchange`, `vgextend`, `vgreduce`, `vgremove`, `vgscan`
- `lvcreate`, `lvextend`, `lvreduce`, `lvchange`, `lvremove`, `lvscan`
- `lvs`, `vgs`, `pvs`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Initial Setup

Before using LVM, ensure the `lvm2` package is installed on your system.

```bash
sudo apt-get install lvm2  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install lvm2      # CentOS/RHEL
```

### Managing Physical Volumes (PV)

1. **Creating a Physical Volume**:

    To create a physical volume, you first need a free disk or partition. Use `fdisk` or `lsblk` to identify a free disk.

    ```bash
    sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb
    ```

2. **Displaying Physical Volume Information**:

    ```bash
    sudo pvscan
    sudo pvs
    ```

3. **Removing a Physical Volume**:

    ```bash
    sudo pvremove /dev/sdb
    ```

### Managing Volume Groups (VG)

1. **Creating a Volume Group**:

    ```bash
    sudo vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdb
    ```

2. **Extending a Volume Group**:

    Add another physical volume to the existing volume group.

    ```bash
    sudo vgextend vg1 /dev/sdc
    ```

3. **Reducing a Volume Group**:

    Remove a physical volume from the volume group.

    ```bash
    sudo vgreduce vg1 /dev/sdc
    ```

4. **Removing a Volume Group**:

    ```bash
    sudo vgremove vg1
    ```

### Managing Logical Volumes (LV)

1. **Creating a Logical Volume**:

    ```bash
    sudo lvcreate -n lv1 -L 10G vg1
    ```

2. **Extending a Logical Volume**:

    Extend the logical volume by an additional size.

    ```bash
    sudo lvextend -L +5G /dev/vg1/lv1
    ```

3. **Reducing a Logical Volume**:

    Reduce the logical volume by a specified size.

    ```bash
    sudo lvreduce -L -5G /dev/vg1/lv1
    ```

4. **Removing a Logical Volume**:

    ```bash
    sudo lvremove /dev/vg1/lv1
    ```

### Using LVM Snapshots

1. **Creating a Snapshot**:

    ```bash
    sudo lvcreate -L 1G -s -n snap_lv1 /dev/vg1/lv1
    ```

2. **Restoring from a Snapshot**:

    ```bash
    sudo lvconvert --merge /dev/vg1/snap_lv1
    ```

### Conclusion

LVM is a powerful tool that offers considerable flexibility in managing disk space on Linux systems. By mastering LVM, administrators can easily adjust their storage architecture as needs evolve. This tutorial has covered the basics of creating, managing, and manipulating physical volumes, volume groups, and logical volumes, along with practical examples to help you get started with LVM. Whether you are managing a single server or a complex multi-disk system, LVM provides the tools necessary to manage your storage effectively and efficiently.
