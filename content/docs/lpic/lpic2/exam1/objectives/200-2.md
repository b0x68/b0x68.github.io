# Tech Tutorial: 200.2 Predict Future Resource Needs

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to monitor resource usage on a Linux system to predict future resource needs. Effective resource monitoring is crucial for maintaining the performance, stability, and scalability of IT systems. By the end of this guide, you will be familiar with using specific Linux utilities to gather and analyze data regarding CPU, memory, disk usage, and network statistics.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Monitoring CPU usage
- Monitoring memory usage
- Monitoring disk usage
- Monitoring network traffic

## Utilities:
- `top`
- `vmstat`
- `iostat`
- `sar`
- `free`
- `iotop`
- `netstat`
- `nmon`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Monitoring CPU Usage

#### Using `top`
The `top` command provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system. It can display system summary information and a list of tasks currently being managed by the Linux kernel.

```bash
top
```

This command displays CPU usage, memory usage, swap usage, and a list of processes that are currently running. Key metrics to watch include:
- `%us`: User CPU time
- `%sy`: System CPU time
- `%id`: Idle CPU time

#### Using `vmstat`
`vmstat` reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity.

```bash
vmstat 1 10
```

This command runs `vmstat` every second for 10 intervals. Look at the `us`, `sy`, and `id` columns for CPU usage.

### 2. Monitoring Memory Usage

#### Using `free`
The `free` command displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap memory in the system.

```bash
free -h
```

The `-h` option makes the output human-readable. This command helps you monitor the availability of RAM in your system.

#### Using `vmstat`
Again, `vmstat` can be used to monitor swap usage along with memory:

```bash
vmstat -s
```

### 3. Monitoring Disk Usage

#### Using `iostat`
`iostat` is used for monitoring system input/output device loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to their average transfer rates.

```bash
iostat -x 1 10
```

Here, `-x` provides extended statistics and `1 10` tells `iostat` to refresh every second for 10 times. Focus on the `%util` field to see how much the disk is being utilized.

#### Using `iotop`
`iotop` watches disk I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel and displays a table of current I/O usage by processes.

```bash
sudo iotop -o
```

The `-o` option only shows processes that are actually doing I/O.

### 4. Monitoring Network Traffic

#### Using `netstat`
`netstat` is a powerful tool for monitoring network connections and statistics.

```bash
netstat -i
```

This command displays a list of network interfaces, useful for monitoring packet transmission errors and status.

#### Using `nmon`
`nmon` is an advanced tool that can monitor and analyze computer performance data including network usage.

```bash
nmon
```

Press `n` to view network statistics.

## Detailed Code Examples

Here are some examples of how these commands can be combined and scripted to provide ongoing monitoring capabilities:

**Daily Report Script**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Daily Resource Usage Report: $(date)"
echo "CPU Usage:"
vmstat 1 5
echo "Memory Usage:"
free -h
echo "Disk Usage:"
iostat -x
echo "Network Statistics:"
netstat -i
```

Save this as `daily_report.sh` and run it with `bash daily_report.sh` to get a snapshot of system resources.

## Conclusion
Monitoring system resources effectively is vital for anticipating future needs and preventing system overloads. By mastering the use of tools like `top`, `vmstat`, `free`, `iostat`, `netstat`, and others, system administrators can keep a close eye on system health and make informed decisions about upgrades, scaling, and resource allocation. Remember, the key to successful system monitoring is not only collecting data but also analyzing trends over time to predict future needs.
