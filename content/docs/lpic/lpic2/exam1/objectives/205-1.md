# Tech Tutorial: 205.1 Basic Networking Configuration

## Introduction

In the realm of Linux system administration, understanding how to configure networking is essential. Networking allows your system to communicate with other computers and services on the internet or local networks. This tutorial aims to equip you with the knowledge to handle basic networking configurations on a Linux system.

## Exam Objective

The objective 205.1 focuses on basic networking configuration, which is a crucial skill for any Linux system administrator. This includes configuring and troubleshooting network interfaces, as well as setting up routing and DNS clients.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Configuring network interfaces
- Basic TCP/IP networking, including knowledge of IP addresses, netmasks, and subnets
- Route tables
- Resolve files
- Utilities to configure and troubleshoot network interfaces

## Utilities

- `ip`
- `ifconfig`
- `route`
- `ss`
- `ping`
- `netstat`
- `cat`
- `echo`
- `grep`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configuring Network Interfaces

#### Using `ip`

The `ip` command is a versatile tool for network configuration. It can be used to show and manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels.

**List all interfaces:**
```bash
ip link show
```

**Set an IP address:**
```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
```

**Bring an interface up:**
```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

**Bring an interface down:**
```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 down
```

#### Using `ifconfig` (deprecated)

Although deprecated, `ifconfig` is still widely used in many systems for network interface configuration.

**List all interfaces:**
```bash
ifconfig -a
```

**Configure an IP address and netmask:**
```bash
sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.100 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
```

### 2. Viewing and Modifying Route Tables

#### Using `route`

**List route entries:**
```bash
route -n
```

**Add a default gateway:**
```bash
sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.1 eth0
```

**Delete a route:**
```bash
sudo route del -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0
```

### 3. Testing Connectivity

#### Using `ping`

Ping is used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network.

```bash
ping -c 4 google.com
```

#### Using `ss` and `netstat`

**List all TCP sockets with `ss`:**
```bash
ss -t -a
```

**List all UDP sockets with `ss`:**
```bash
ss -u -a
```

**Display routing table with `netstat`:**
```bash
netstat -r
```

**Display all network interfaces with `netstat`:**
```bash
netstat -i
```

### 4. DNS Client Configuration

#### `/etc/resolv.conf`

DNS client settings are configured in `/etc/resolv.conf`.

**View DNS settings:**
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

**Set a DNS server:**
```bash
echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to configure and troubleshoot basic network settings on a Linux system. We looked at how to manage network interfaces, modify route tables, test connectivity, and configure DNS settings. With these skills, you should be able to handle fundamental networking tasks in your Linux environment.
