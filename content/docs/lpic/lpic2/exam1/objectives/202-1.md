# Tech Tutorial: 202.1 Customizing System Startup

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into customizing the system startup process on Linux-based systems. Understanding and being able to customize the startup process is crucial for system administrators to ensure that their systems are configured precisely for their needs, whether for security, performance, or special functionalities.

We will cover key utilities and commands used to manage system services, check service statuses, and customize service behavior during boot.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Understanding the boot process and its components
- Managing system services
- Enabling and disabling services
- Checking service status

## Utilities:
- `systemctl`
- `chkconfig`
- `service`
- `update-rc.d`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding the Boot Process

Before diving into commands and utilities, it's essential to understand the boot process. Linux boot process stages include:
- BIOS/UEFI stage
- Bootloader stage (GRUB)
- Kernel loading
- Init process (SysVinit, Upstart, or systemd)

Most modern Linux distributions use `systemd` as their init system, which brings us to our first utility.

### 2. Using `systemctl`

`systemctl` is the central management tool for controlling the `systemd` system and service manager.

#### Start a Service
To start a service immediately:
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2.service
```

#### Enable a Service at Boot
To enable a service to start on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable apache2.service
```

This creates a symbolic link from the system's copy of the service file (usually in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/`) to the location systemd reads at startup.

#### Disable a Service at Boot
To prevent a service from starting on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable apache2.service
```

#### Check Status of a Service
To check the status of a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2.service
```

### 3. Using `chkconfig`

For systems using legacy SysVinit, `chkconfig` is used for managing system services.

#### List Service Status
To list all services and their boot settings:
```bash
chkconfig --list
```

#### Enable a Service
To enable a service at runtime levels 2, 3, and 5:
```bash
sudo chkconfig apache2 on
```

#### Disable a Service
To disable a service:
```bash
sudo chkconfig apache2 off
```

### 4. Using `service`

The `service` command is used in SysVinit systems to run a System V init script.

#### Start a Service
To start a service:
```bash
sudo service apache2 start
```

#### Stop a Service
To stop a service:
```bash
sudo service apache2 stop
```

#### Restart a Service
To restart a service:
```bash
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### 5. Using `update-rc.d`

`update-rc.d` is another tool for managing SysVinit scripts in Debian-based systems.

#### Enable a Service
To enable a service:
```bash
sudo update-rc.d apache2 enable
```

#### Disable a Service
To disable a service:
```bash
sudo update-rc.d apache2 disable
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and mastering service management commands and tools is essential for any Linux system administrator. Whether you're using a modern system with `systemd` or maintaining older systems with SysVinit, the ability to control what services start at boot and how they behave is a powerful tool in your arsenal.

Remember, the exact commands may vary slightly based on your Linux distribution and the init system it uses, so always refer to your distribution's documentation for the most accurate information.
