# Tech Tutorial: 211.1 Using E-mail Servers

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we will explore how to set up and manage e-mail servers on Linux. E-mail servers are crucial for handling the sending, receiving, and storing of email messages. We'll specifically delve into the Postfix SMTP server, one of the most popular mail servers on Linux, and explore utilities such as `sendmail`, `postconf`, and `postqueue`.

## Exam Objective:
- Configure email services.
- Understand different protocols involved in email delivery.
- Manage email delivery systems.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Basic Postfix configuration
- Managing the mail queue
- Troubleshooting the mail system

## Utilities:
- `sendmail`
- `postconf`
- `postqueue`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installation of Postfix
We begin by installing Postfix. It's available in most Linux distributions' package repositories.

#### Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postfix
```

#### CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum install postfix
sudo systemctl start postfix
sudo systemctl enable postfix
```

### 2. Basic Configuration of Postfix
After installation, you need to configure Postfix. The main configuration file for Postfix is `/etc/postfix/main.cf`.

#### Setting the hostname:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'myhostname = mail.example.com'
```

#### Setting the domain:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'mydomain = example.com'
```

#### Setting up a network to receive mail from:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/24'
```

#### Enable Internet Mail Delivery:
```bash
sudo postconf -e 'inet_interfaces = all'
```

### 3. Controlling Mail Queue with `postqueue`
Postfix manages a queue of email messages to be sent. You can manipulate and inspect this queue using `postqueue`.

#### Viewing the mail queue:
```bash
postqueue -p
```

#### To flush the mail queue (process all pending messages):
```bash
postqueue -f
```

#### To remove all mails from the queue:
```bash
postsuper -d ALL
```

### 4. Using `sendmail`
The `sendmail` command can be used for sending emails from the command line, which is useful for scripts or automated notifications.

#### Sending an email:
```bash
echo "Body of your email" | sendmail -v recipient@example.com
```

#### Sending an email with a subject:
```bash
echo "Subject: Test Mail" | sendmail -v recipient@example.com
```

### 5. Advanced Configuration with `postconf`
`postconf` is used to query or change Postfix configuration settings.

#### List all Postfix configuration parameters:
```bash
postconf -d
```

#### Change a configuration parameter:
```bash
postconf -e 'message_size_limit = 20480000'
```

#### Check configuration for errors:
```bash
postfix check
```

### 6. Troubleshooting
Common issues might include mail not being sent or received, which can often be diagnosed through logs.

#### Viewing logs (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
cat /var/log/mail.log
```

#### Viewing logs (CentOS/RHEL):
```bash
cat /var/log/maillog
```

## Conclusion
Setting up an email server with Postfix on Linux is a robust solution for handling enterprise-level email delivery. By understanding the primary commands and configurations as discussed, you can effectively manage an email server. Whether it's through direct command-line utilities or modifying configuration files, Linux offers comprehensive tools to ensure your mail systems are efficient and secure.

Remember, email server configuration can vary based on specific requirements and security policies, so always tailor your setup to fit your needs.
