# Tech Tutorial: 210.3 LDAP Client Usage

## Introduction

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used for accessing and managing directory services over an IP network. This tutorial aims to cover the LDAP client usage, which is crucial for interacting with LDAP servers to perform operations like search, add, modify, and delete directory entries. This tutorial will focus on teaching you how to use LDAP utilities from a Linux client perspective.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understanding LDAP
- Installation and configuration of LDAP clients
- Searching in the LDAP directory
- Modifying LDAP entries
- Adding and removing LDAP entries
- LDAP utilities

## Utilities

- ldapsearch
- ldapadd
- ldapdelete
- ldapmodify

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installation and Configuration

Before you can use the LDAP utilities, you need to install them on your Linux system. Most Linux distributions include the OpenLDAP client utilities in their package repositories.

**For Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ldap-utils
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install openldap-clients
```

### 2. Searching in the LDAP Directory

The `ldapsearch` utility is used to search and retrieve entries from an LDAP directory. The basic syntax is:

```bash
ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap://<hostname>:<port> -b <baseDN> "<filter>" <attributes>
```

**Example:** Search for all users in the `dc=example,dc=com` domain.

```bash
ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389 -b "dc=example,dc=com" "(objectClass=person)" cn mail
```

This command will connect to the LDAP server at `ldap.example.com` on port 389, search for all entries with `objectClass=person` under the base DN `dc=example,dc=com`, and retrieve the `cn` (common name) and `mail` attributes.

### 3. Adding LDAP Entries

To add a new entry to the LDAP directory, you can use the `ldapadd` utility. You need to provide the details of the new entry in the LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) file.

**Example:** Create a new user named John Doe.

Create a file named `newuser.ldif` with the following content:

```ldif
dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: John Doe
sn: Doe
mail: johndoe@example.com
userPassword: password123
```

Then run:

```bash
ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f newuser.ldif
```

This command will prompt for the password of the `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com` user and then add the new user as specified in the `newuser.ldif` file.

### 4. Modifying LDAP Entries

To modify an existing entry, use the `ldapmodify` utility. Like `ldapadd`, modifications need to be specified in an LDIF file.

**Example:** Change John Doe's email.

Create a file named `modifyuser.ldif` with the following content:

```ldif
dn: cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com
changetype: modify
replace: mail
mail: newemail@example.com
```

Then run:

```bash
ldapmodify -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f modifyuser.ldif
```

### 5. Deleting LDAP Entries

To remove an entry from the LDAP directory, use the `ldapdelete` utility.

**Example:** Delete the user John Doe.

```bash
ldapdelete -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W "cn=John Doe,dc=example,dc=com"
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basic LDAP client operations such as searching, adding, modifying, and deleting LDAP entries using various utilities like ldapsearch, ldapadd, ldapmodify, and ldapdelete. With these tools, you can efficiently manage LDAP directory services from a Linux client, facilitating seamless integration and administration of user and group data across networked systems.
