# Tech Tutorial: 211.2 Managing E-Mail Delivery (weight: 2)

## Introduction

Email management on a Linux system involves setting up and configuring mail transfer agents (MTAs), understanding the role of various utilities, and knowing how to troubleshoot common mail delivery issues. This tutorial aims to cover these areas with a focus on the essential utilities required for managing email delivery as specified in the LPIC exam objective 211.2.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
1. Configure email aliases
2. Configure email forwarding
3. Knowledge of commonly available MTA programs (Postfix, Sendmail, Exim) (no configuration)

## Utilities:
- `sendmail`
- `newaliases`
- `mail`
- `.forward`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configuring Email Aliases

Email aliases allow you to forward emails from one address to another. This can be particularly useful in managing emails in an organization. Let's consider Postfix for configuring email aliases.

#### Example:
```bash
# First, ensure Postfix is installed and running
sudo apt install postfix
sudo systemctl start postfix
sudo systemctl enable postfix

# Edit the aliases file
sudo nano /etc/aliases

# Add an alias
# Syntax: alias_name: destination_email
webmaster: admin@example.com

# Apply the alias changes
sudo newaliases

# Restart Postfix to ensure changes take effect
sudo systemctl restart postfix
```

### 2. Configuring Email Forwarding

To forward emails from one user to another or to an external email, we use the `.forward` file in the user's home directory.

#### Example:
```bash
# Login as the user or use sudo to edit/create the .forward file
echo 'destination@example.com' > ~/.forward

# Ensure the file has correct permissions
chmod 0644 ~/.forward
```

### 3. Sending Email Using `mail`

The `mail` command is a simple utility to send and receive emails from the command line.

#### Example:
```bash
# Sending an email
echo "This is the body of the email" | mail -s "This is the subject" user@example.com

# Sending an email with an attachment
echo "Find the attached document." | mail -s "Attached Document" -A /path/to/document.pdf user@example.com
```

### 4. Using `sendmail` Command

Although Postfix and other modern MTAs have largely replaced Sendmail, the `sendmail` command is still widely used for its compatibility and direct control over mail sending.

#### Example:
```bash
# Send an email using sendmail
sendmail user@example.com << EOF
Subject: Test Email
From: your-email@example.com
To: user@example.com

This is a test email sent by sendmail.
EOF
```

## Detailed Code Examples

Each example provided above demonstrates real-world usage scenarios for managing email delivery. By configuring aliases and forwarding, system administrators can efficiently manage email flows within an organization. Using `mail` and `sendmail` provides flexibility in sending emails through scripts or command line, which can be particularly useful for automated notifications and system alerts.

## Conclusion

Managing email delivery requires a solid understanding of the available tools and utilities, as outlined in this tutorial. By mastering the configuration of email aliases, setting up forwarding, and utilizing command-line utilities like `mail` and `sendmail`, you can effectively manage email operations on a Linux server. This knowledge not only helps in passing the LPIC-2 exam but also in practical, real-world system administration.
