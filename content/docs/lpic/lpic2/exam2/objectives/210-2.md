# Tech Tutorial: 210.2 PAM Authentication

## Introduction

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a mechanism for integrating multiple low-level authentication schemes into a high-level API, allowing for programs that rely on authentication to be written independently of the underlying authentication scheme. This tutorial aims to explore the configuration and management of PAM, a crucial topic for system administrators and security professionals working with Linux systems.

## Exam Objective

The key objective of this section is to understand and manage PAM authentication, including the configuration of PAM files and the use of various PAM tools and utilities.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Configuration of PAM
- Understanding of `/etc/pam.d/`
- Familiarity with PAM management utilities

## Utilities:
- `pam_tally2`
- `pam_cracklib`
- `pam_unix`
- `pam_wheel`
- `pam_nologin`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding PAM Configuration Files

PAM configuration files are located in the `/etc/pam.d/` directory. Each service that uses PAM has its own file. For example, the SSH service configuration is in `/etc/pam.d/sshd`.

#### Example:
```bash
# View content of PAM configuration for SSH
cat /etc/pam.d/sshd
```

### 2. Configuring PAM Modules

PAM modules are configured in the service files located in `/etc/pam.d/`. Each line in these files describes a step in the authentication process.

#### Example:
```bash
# Sample entry in /etc/pam.d/common-password
password    requisite                       pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=8 difok=3
```
This line configures the `pam_cracklib` module to enforce password strength policies.

### 3. Using `pam_tally2` for Login Attempts Management

`pam_tally2` module is used to lock user accounts after certain failed login attempts.

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Add to /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=3 unlock_time=300
```

#### Resetting Fail Count:
```bash
# Reset fail count for user
pam_tally2 --user=username --reset
```

### 4. Enhancing Security with `pam_cracklib`

`pam_cracklib` is a module for enforcing password policies.

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Edit /etc/pam.d/common-password
password    requisite   pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3
```

### 5. Using `pam_unix` for Standard Unix Authentication

This module provides standard Unix authentication.

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Example entry in /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth    required    pam_unix.so nullok
```

### 6. Restricting Access with `pam_wheel`

`pam_wheel` is used for restricting access to `su` or `sudo` to users in the wheel group.

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Add to /etc/pam.d/su
auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid
```

### 7. Managing System-wide Logins with `pam_nologin`

`pam_nologin` denies login if the file `/etc/nologin` exists.

#### Configuration:
```bash
# Add to /etc/pam.d/login
auth    requisite   pam_nologin.so
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and configuring PAM is essential for managing authentication and enhancing security on Linux systems. By mastering the various PAM modules and utilities like `pam_tally2`, `pam_cracklib`, `pam_unix`, `pam_wheel`, and `pam_nologin`, administrators can ensure robust authentication mechanisms aligned with security policies and requirements. Always test configurations in a controlled environment before applying them to production systems to avoid unintended access issues.
