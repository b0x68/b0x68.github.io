# Tech Tutorial: 212.4 Security tasks (weight: 3)

## Introduction

Security in Linux systems is paramount to ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the systems and their resources. In this tutorial, we'll delve into essential security tasks that every Linux system administrator should be familiar with. We'll cover various utilities and commands associated with auditing and managing user and group permissions, configuring system-wide restrictions, and ensuring that only authorized users can access certain system functionalities.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Auditing a system to find security vulnerabilities
- Managing user/group permissions and ownership
- Configuring user and group disk quotas
- Using Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

## Utilities

- `auditd`
- `chown`, `chgrp`, `chmod`
- `setfacl`, `getfacl`
- `usermod`, `groupmod`
- `edquota`, `repquota`
- `pam_tally2`, `faillog`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Auditing with `auditd`

The `auditd` daemon is part of the Linux Auditing System that logs security-relevant information based on preconfigured rules. Here's how you can configure and use `auditd`:

#### Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install auditd  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install auditd      # CentOS/RHEL
```

#### Configuration

To log all actions by the `root` user:

```bash
sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p war -k shadow-watch
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S all -F uid=0 -k root-activity
```

#### Viewing Logs

```bash
sudo ausearch -k root-activity
```

### 2. Managing Permissions

#### Changing Ownership with `chown`

To change the owner of a file:

```bash
sudo chown newowner filename.txt
```

To change the owner recursively in a directory:

```bash
sudo chown -R newowner /path/to/directory
```

#### Changing Group Ownership with `chgrp`

To change the group ownership of a file:

```bash
sudo chgrp newgroup filename.txt
```

#### Modifying Permissions with `chmod`

To give full permissions to the owner and read/execute to others:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 filename.txt
```

### 3. Using ACLs with `setfacl` and `getfacl`

#### Setting ACL

To give a specific user read/write access to a file:

```bash
setfacl -m u:username:rw filename.txt
```

#### Viewing ACL

```bash
getfacl filename.txt
```

### 4. Disk Quotas

#### Editing Quotas

To edit quotas for users:

```bash
sudo edquota -u username
```

#### Reporting Quotas

```bash
sudo repquota -a
```

### 5. Configuring PAM

#### Using `pam_tally2` to Lock User Accounts

To lock an account after three unsuccessful login attempts:

```bash
echo "auth required pam_tally2.so deny=3 unlock_time=600" >> /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```

#### Checking Account Lock Status

```bash
sudo pam_tally2 -u username
```

#### Resetting the Fail Count

```bash
sudo pam_tally2 -u username -r
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered several fundamental security tasks for Linux systems. From auditing with `auditd` to managing user permissions and configuring disk quotas, these tasks are critical for maintaining a secure environment. Always ensure to test these configurations in a safe testing environment before deploying them in a production setting. Security is an ongoing process, and staying informed and vigilant is key to protecting your systems.
