# Tech Tutorial: 210.1 DHCP Configuration

## Introduction

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an essential service in any network that allows devices to automatically receive a valid IP address and other related configuration information such as subnet mask and default gateway. In this tutorial, we will explore how to install, configure, and manage the DHCP server on a Linux system. This guide will provide detailed examples of setting up a DHCP server using `isc-dhcp-server`, a popular DHCP server software.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- DHCP configuration files, terms, and utilities
- Subnet and static IP assignment
- Awareness of DHCP relay

## Utilities

- dhcpd
- dhcpd.conf
- dhclient

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Install the DHCP Server

First, you need to install the DHCP server package. On Debian-based systems, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-server
```

For Red Hat-based systems, use:

```bash
sudo yum install dhcp
```

### Step 2: Configure the DHCP Server

Configuration for the DHCP server is stored in `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. You'll need to edit this file to fit the needs of your network.

#### Basic Configuration

Here’s a simple example of what the configuration might look like for a small network:

```bash
subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    range 192.168.1.20 192.168.1.100;
    option routers 192.168.1.1;
    option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
    option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
    default-lease-time 600;
    max-lease-time 7200;
}
```

This configuration:
- Defines a subnet `192.168.1.0` with a netmask of `255.255.255.0`.
- Specifies a range of IP addresses from `192.168.1.20` to `192.168.1.100` that can be assigned.
- Sets the default gateway (`option routers`) to `192.168.1.1`.
- Provides DNS servers as `8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`.
- Sets the default lease time to 600 seconds, and the maximum lease time to 7200 seconds.

#### Assigning Fixed IP Addresses

To assign a fixed IP address to a device with a specific MAC address, add the following within your subnet declaration:

```bash
host specialHost {
    hardware ethernet 00:11:22:33:44:55;
    fixed-address 192.168.1.101;
}
```

### Step 3: Start and Enable the DHCP Server

After configuring the server, start it and enable it to start at boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start isc-dhcp-server
sudo systemctl enable isc-dhcp-server
```

### Step 4: Testing the DHCP Server

Use `dhclient` to test the DHCP server from a client machine:

```bash
sudo dhclient -v eth0
```

This command will release any current IP address the client has and attempt to lease a new one from the DHCP server.

## Detailed Code Examples for Every Single Command

### dhcpd

This is the main DHCP server daemon. Here’s how to manually start it with a specific configuration file:

```bash
sudo dhcpd -cf /etc/dhcp/custom-dhcpd.conf
```

### dhcpd.conf

This is the configuration file. Here’s how to specify a different DNS server in `dhcpd.conf`:

```bash
option domain-name-servers 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1;
```

### dhclient

This is the DHCP client program. Here’s how to release and renew an IP address:

```bash
sudo dhclient -r  # release current IP
sudo dhclient     # obtain a new IP
```

## Conclusion

Configuring a DHCP server on your Linux system can significantly simplify network management by automating IP address distribution and configuration tasks. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should now have a basic DHCP server set up and understand how to manage its configuration for different network requirements. Regularly check logs and test configurations to ensure optimal network performance and security.
