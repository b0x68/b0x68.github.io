# Tech Tutorial: 212.3 Secure Shell (SSH) (weight: 4)

## Introduction

Secure Shell (SSH) is an essential protocol used primarily for secure remote login from one computer to another. It provides several alternatives for strong authentication and protects the communications security and integrity with robust encryption. This tutorial aims to delve into the usage of SSH for secure communications and how to manage its settings for optimal security and functionality.

## Exam Objective

- Configure SSH keys and SSH-agent to manage private keys.
- Use ssh and scp commands.
- Install and configure SSH server and client.
- Analyze and utilize /etc/ssh/sshd_config and ~/.ssh/config files.
- Port forwarding, X11 forwarding.

## Utilities

- ssh
- ssh-keygen
- ssh-agent
- ssh-add
- scp
- sshd (SSH daemon)
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config
- ~/.ssh/config

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installing SSH

Before you can use SSH, you need to ensure it is installed on both the server and client machines.

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-server openssh-client
```

**On CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo yum install openssh-server openssh-clients
```

**On Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install openssh-server openssh-clients
```

### 2. Configuring SSH Keys with ssh-keygen

SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a server with SSH than using a password alone.

**Generating SSH Keys:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.

**Output Example:**

```plaintext
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
Your identification has been saved in /home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/your_username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

### 3. Managing SSH Agent

The SSH agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication.

**Starting ssh-agent:**

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

**Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent:**

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 4. Using `ssh` and `scp`

**Connecting to a remote server:**

```bash
ssh username@remote_host
```

**Copying files with `scp`:**

To copy a file from your local machine to a remote server:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/file username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/directory
```

To copy a file from a remote server to your local machine:

```bash
scp username@remote_host:/path/to/remote/file /path/to/local/directory
```

### 5. SSH Configurations

**Server Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):**

To disable root login, edit the sshd_config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Add or modify the following line:

```plaintext
PermitRootLogin no
```

**Client Configuration (`~/.ssh/config`):**

Create a config file for easier management of multiple connections:

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Example configuration:

```plaintext
Host myserver
    HostName server.example.com
    User myusername
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myserver_rsa
```

### 6. Port Forwarding and X11 Forwarding

**Local Port Forwarding:**

```bash
ssh -L localPort:remoteHost:remotePort username@sshServer
```

**Remote Port Forwarding:**

```bash
ssh -R remotePort:localhost:localPort username@sshServer
```

**X11 Forwarding:**

```bash
ssh -X username@remote_host
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the essentials of setting up and using SSH for secure remote connections and file transfers. Through properly configuring and managing SSH keys and understanding the SSH configuration files, you can significantly enhance the security of your remote sessions and transfers. Always remember to keep your private keys secure and regularly update your configurations in line with best security practices.
