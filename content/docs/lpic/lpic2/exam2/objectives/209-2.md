# Tech Tutorial: 209.2 NFS Server Configuration

## Introduction

Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in a manner similar to how local storage is accessed. NFS, originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1980s, has evolved through numerous versions, the most common being NFSv3 and NFSv4.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to configure an NFS server on a Linux system. This involves installing the necessary software, setting up the NFS exports, and ensuring proper security and performance configurations. This tutorial is aimed at system administrators and IT professionals preparing for the LFCS (Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin) exam, specifically focusing on the NFS Server Configuration.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understand NFS architecture and versions
- Install NFS server
- Configure exports
- Manage NFS shares
- Secure NFS
- Troubleshoot NFS issues

## Utilities:

- `/etc/exports`
- `exportfs`
- `showmount`
- `mount`
- `systemctl`
- `nfsstat`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing NFS Server

Before configuring NFS, you need to install the NFS server package on your Linux distribution.

#### On Ubuntu/Debian systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
```

#### On CentOS/RHEL systems:

```bash
sudo yum update
sudo yum install nfs-utils
```

### Step 2: Configuring NFS Exports

The NFS exports are defined in the `/etc/exports` file. This file specifies which directories are shared and the permissions attached to them.

1. **Create a shared directory:**

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir /var/nfs/general -p
    sudo chown nobody:nogroup /var/nfs/general
    ```

2. **Edit the `/etc/exports` file to add the export:**

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/exports
    ```

    Add the following line to share the directory with a client:

    ```plaintext
    /var/nfs/general 192.168.1.100(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
    ```

    - `rw`: Allow read and write permissions.
    - `sync`: Reply to requests only after the changes have been committed to stable storage.
    - `no_subtree_check`: Prevent subtree checking.

3. **Export the shares and restart NFS service:**

    ```bash
    sudo exportfs -a
    sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
    ```

### Step 3: Managing NFS Shares

Use `exportfs` to manage NFS shares:

- **Show exported file systems:**

    ```bash
    sudo exportfs -v
    ```

- **Re-export all directories after modification of `/etc/exports`:**

    ```bash
    sudo exportfs -ra
    ```

### Step 4: Client Configuration

On the client machine, install NFS client utilities and mount the NFS share:

```bash
sudo apt install nfs-common  # On Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install nfs-utils   # On CentOS/RHEL

sudo mkdir /mnt/nfs
sudo mount 192.168.1.100:/var/nfs/general /mnt/nfs
```

### Step 5: Security and Permissions

Ensure the NFS server is secured by managing access through `/etc/exports` and using firewalls to limit access:

- **Firewall configuration example on Ubuntu:**

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.100 to any port nfs
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw status
    ```

### Step 6: Troubleshooting NFS

Use `nfsstat` and `showmount` to troubleshoot:

- **Check NFS statistics:**

    ```bash
    nfsstat
    ```

- **Show mountable volumes from the server:**

    ```bash
    showmount -e 192.168.1.100
    ```

## Conclusion

Configuring an NFS server involves setting up and managing shared directories, securing access, and ensuring that clients can mount the shares as needed. Remember to monitor and troubleshoot your NFS setup regularly using the provided utilities to maintain optimal performance and security. This setup not only helps in passing the LFCS exam but also in managing real-world network file systems efficiently.
