# Tech Tutorial: 332.3 Resource Control (weight: 3)

## Exam Objective:

The aim of this tutorial is to equip you with the knowledge to manage and control system resources in a Linux environment. This includes setting limits for user processes, managing kernel resources, and controlling system services using various utilities.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding and managing user and system limits.
- Configuring and managing kernel parameters.
- Using tools to control system resource allocation.

## Utilities:

- `ulimit`
- `sysctl`
- `systemctl`

## Introduction

In a Linux system, controlling resources effectively is crucial for maintaining system stability, security, and performance. This tutorial will delve into how to use `ulimit`, `sysctl`, and `systemctl` to manage and restrict resources for users and system processes.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Managing User Limits with `ulimit`

The `ulimit` utility is used to control the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it. You can set limits on various resources like CPU time, file sizes, and number of processes.

#### Detailed Code Examples:

**Viewing Current Limits**
```bash
ulimit -a
```

**Setting a Specific Limit**

- Set the maximum file size to 1000000 blocks:
```bash
ulimit -f 1000000
```

- Set the maximum number of open file descriptors:
```bash
ulimit -n 1024
```

**Applying Limits for a Specific Session**
```bash
ulimit -u 50  # maximum user processes
ulimit -t 60  # CPU time in seconds
```

### 2. Configuring Kernel Parameters with `sysctl`

`sysctl` is used to modify kernel parameters at runtime. Parameters are found under `/proc/sys/` and can be both viewed and set using `sysctl`.

#### Detailed Code Examples:

**Viewing a Kernel Parameter**
```bash
sysctl vm.swappiness
```

**Setting a Kernel Parameter**
```bash
sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10
```

**Persistent Configuration**

Edit or create `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add:
```plaintext
vm.swappiness = 10
```
Then run:
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

### 3. Controlling System Services with `systemctl`

`systemctl` is used to examine and control the systemd system and service manager.

#### Detailed Code Examples:

**Start a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

**Stop a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
```

**Enable a Service at Boot**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

**Check Status of a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

**Restart a Service**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered how to use `ulimit`, `sysctl`, and `systemctl` for effective resource control in Linux. Understanding these utilities allows you to manage system resources proactively, ensuring that your Linux systems run efficiently and reliably. Whether you are limiting user process resources with `ulimit`, adjusting kernel parameters via `sysctl`, or managing service states with `systemctl`, these tools are indispensable for system administrators.
