# Tech Tutorial: 332.2 Host Intrusion Detection

## Introduction

Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) are essential tools for monitoring and analyzing system behavior and state, identifying unauthorized activities that can indicate a breach or other security incidents. In this tutorial, we will cover various utilities and methods that can be employed to implement a HIDS on a Linux system. Weâ€™ll focus on practical, hands-on examples to ensure you can apply these tools effectively.

## Exam Objective:

The objective is to understand, implement, and manage host-based intrusion detection systems.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding of host intrusion detection principles
- Installation and configuration of AIDE
- Understanding of key features of intrusion detection systems such as log monitoring, file integrity checking, and real-time alerting

## Utilities:

- AIDE
- Auditd
- Syslog

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)

AIDE is a file and directory integrity checker, which helps in detecting unauthorized changes.

#### Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aide
```

#### Configuration:

Initialize the database before starting the monitoring.

```bash
sudo aideinit
```

This will create a snapshot of the current system state, which AIDE will use for comparison in future checks.

#### Running a Check:

To check for changes, run:

```bash
sudo aide --check
```

This command compares the current state of the system to the snapshot stored in the database.

### 2. Auditd

`auditd` is the Linux Audit daemon, part of the Linux Auditing System, which can record system calls, file accesses, and other events.

#### Installation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install auditd
```

#### Configuration:

To monitor file access on `/etc/passwd`, add a rule:

```bash
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p war -k password-file
```

- `-w` specifies the file to watch
- `-p war` specifies to watch for write, append, and read access
- `-k` sets a key name for easy identification in logs

#### Viewing Logs:

To see the logs related to the `password-file`:

```bash
sudo ausearch -k password-file
```

### 3. Syslog

Syslog is a standard for message logging. It can be used to consolidate logs from different sources for analysis.

#### Configuration for Intrusion Detection:

Configure `/etc/rsyslog.conf` to forward logs to a central server:

```bash
*.* @192.168.1.100:514
```

This forwards all logs to the server at `192.168.1.100` on port `514`.

#### Checking Syslog Messages:

To check syslog messages locally:

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog
```

## Detailed Code Examples

### Enhanced AIDE Usage:

Automate the checking process with a cron job:

```bash
echo "0 3 * * * root /usr/bin/aide --check" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab
```

This sets up a daily check at 03:00 AM.

### Advanced Auditd Monitoring:

Monitor all commands executed by the user `alice`:

```bash
sudo auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -F auid=1001 -k alice-actions
```

- `execve` is the system call for executing a new program.
- `auid=1001` should be replaced with Alice's actual UID.

### Syslog Remote Logging:

Enhance security by limiting access to the syslog server:

```bash
*.* @@192.168.1.100:514
```

Using `@@` ensures encrypted syslog messages are sent over TCP.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored several key utilities (AIDE, Auditd, and Syslog) for implementing host intrusion detection systems on Linux. By following the examples and adjusting configurations as needed, you can strengthen the security posture of your Linux systems against unauthorized changes and potential breaches. Regular monitoring and updating of the detection rules are essential to maintaining an effective HIDS.
