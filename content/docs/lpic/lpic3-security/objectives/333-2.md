# Tech Tutorial: 333.2 Mandatory Access Control (weight: 5)

## Introduction

Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is a security model in which access rights are regulated by a central authority based on different levels of security. This tutorial will focus on understanding and implementing MAC on Linux systems, particularly through the use of Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) and AppArmor, which are the most common MAC frameworks used in Linux environments.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understand the concepts of SELinux and AppArmor
- Manage and implement SELinux and AppArmor policies
- Troubleshoot SELinux and AppArmor issues

## Utilities:

- SELinux: `sestatus`, `getenforce`, `setenforce`, `semanage`, `restorecon`, `chcon`, `audit2allow`, `audit2why`
- AppArmor: `aa-status`, `aa-enforce`, `aa-complain`, `aa-disable`, `aa-genprof`, `aa-logprof`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### SELinux

#### 1. Checking SELinux Status

The `sestatus` command provides the current status of SELinux on your system.

```bash
sestatus
```

#### 2. Get Current Enforcing Mode

To check if SELinux is enforcing, permissive, or disabled, use:

```bash
getenforce
```

#### 3. Set Enforcing Mode

To toggle SELinux between enforcing and permissive mode (without reboot), use:

```bash
sudo setenforce Enforcing
sudo setenforce Permissive
```

#### 4. Manage SELinux Policies

The `semanage` command is a powerful tool for managing SELinux policies.

- List SELinux user mappings:

```bash
semanage login -l
```

- Add a new mapping:

```bash
sudo semanage login -a -s sysadm_u -r s0-s0:c0.c1023 new_user
```

#### 5. Restore Default File Contexts

If file contexts get corrupted or changed, they can be restored using:

```bash
restorecon -v /path/to/file
```

#### 6. Change File Context

To manually change the SELinux context of a file, use:

```bash
chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t /var/www/html/index.html
```

#### 7. Analyzing AVC Messages

Convert AVC messages from logs into SELinux policy allow rules using:

```bash
audit2allow -w -a
audit2allow -a -M mypol
```

#### 8. Understanding Denials

To understand why certain operations were denied by SELinux:

```bash
audit2why -a
```

### AppArmor

#### 1. Checking AppArmor Status

To see the status of AppArmor and profiles:

```bash
sudo aa-status
```

#### 2. Switching Modes

To toggle a profile between enforcing and complain mode:

```bash
sudo aa-enforce /path/to/profile
sudo aa-complain /path/to/profile
```

#### 3. Disable a Profile

To disable an AppArmor profile:

```bash
sudo aa-disable /path/to/profile
```

#### 4. Generate and Update Profiles

- Generate a new profile interactively:

```bash
sudo aa-genprof /path/to/application
```

- Update a profile from log data interactively:

```bash
sudo aa-logprof
```

## Detailed Code Examples

Each command listed above is critical for managing and troubleshooting SELinux and AppArmor on your system. These examples provide a real-world context to help you understand their usage thoroughly. For instance:

```bash
# Enforcing SELinux and then checking status
sudo setenforce 1
sestatus
```

This sequence sets SELinux to enforcing mode and then checks to confirm the change was applied.

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing Mandatory Access Control with SELinux and AppArmor adds an essential layer of security to your Linux systems. By mastering these commands and concepts, you can effectively manage security policies and ensure your systems are protected against unauthorized access. Remember, regular practice and continued learning are key to mastering Linux security administration.
