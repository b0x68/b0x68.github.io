# Tech Tutorial: 334.2 Network Intrusion Detection (weight: 4)

In this tutorial, we will delve into the realm of network intrusion detection, focusing on the key knowledge areas relevant to the exam objective 334.2. Understanding and implementing effective network intrusion detection strategies are critical to maintaining the security and integrity of network infrastructures.

## Introduction

Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential tools that help in monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats. They analyze traffic to detect signs of malicious activities or policy violations. This tutorial will cover popular utilities like Snort and Bro (now known as Zeek), which are commonly used for network intrusion detection.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Installation and configuration of Snort
- Basic operation of Snort
- Understanding, writing, and maintaining rules in Snort
- Installation and configuration of Bro/Zeek
- Basic operation of Bro/Zeek
- Understanding, writing, and maintaining scripts in Bro/Zeek

## Utilities:

- `snort`
- `zeek`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installation and Configuration of Snort

#### Installation:

Snort is available from its official website or can be installed through package managers. For Debian-based systems:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort
```

For Red Hat-based systems:

```bash
sudo yum install snort
```

#### Configuration:

After installation, configure Snort by editing its configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

You need to set up the network variables to reflect your environment:

```text
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
ipvar EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET
```

#### Testing the Configuration:

To test if Snort is set up correctly:

```bash
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

### 2. Basic Operation of Snort

To run Snort in network intrusion detection mode with console output:

```bash
sudo snort -q -A console -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

Replace `eth0` with your network interface.

### 3. Snort Rules

Rules in Snort are written in a straightforward format that specifies what to look for and what to do when it finds it. Here is an example of a simple rule:

```text
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 443 (msg:"Possible SSL Traffic"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

To add this rule, append it to `/etc/snort/rules/local.rules` and restart Snort.

### 4. Installation and Configuration of Bro/Zeek

#### Installation:

Install Zeek from the official repository:

```bash
sudo apt install zeek
```

#### Configuration:

Edit the main configuration file to adjust settings:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/zeek/etc/node.cfg
```

Set appropriate network interface:

```text
[zeek]
type=standalone
host=localhost
interface=eth0
```

### 5. Basic Operation of Bro/Zeek

To run Zeek in real-time mode:

```bash
sudo zeekctl deploy
```

This command checks the configuration, starts Zeek, and keeps it running.

### 6. Bro/Zeek Scripts

Scripts in Zeek allow for complex event handling. Here's an example of a script that logs HTTP GET requests:

```zeek
event http_request(c: connection, method: string, original_URI: string) {
    if (method == "GET") {
        print fmt("GET request observed: %s", original_URI);
    }
}
```

Save this script as `http_get.zeek` and load it by modifying `local.zeek`:

```bash
@load ./http_get
```

## Conclusion

Effective use of tools like Snort and Zeek is crucial for network security. This tutorial provided an introduction to setting up and using these tools for intrusion detection. Mastery of these tools requires continuous learning and practical application, so keep practicing and stay updated with the latest in cybersecurity.

Remember, the security of your network infrastructure depends significantly on proactive measures and the effective detection of potential threats. Happy securing!
