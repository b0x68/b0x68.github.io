# Tech Tutorial: 334.3 Packet Filtering

## Introduction
Packet filtering is a crucial security measure that controls network access by monitoring outgoing and incoming packets and allowing them to pass or halt based on a set of security rules. It is a fundamental aspect of firewall configurations in Linux. This tutorial covers the essential aspects of packet filtering, focusing on the utilities iptables and nftables, the two most widely used tools in Linux for managing firewall rules.

## Exam Objective:
The objective of this tutorial is to equip learners with the knowledge and skills needed to configure and manage packet filtering using iptables and nftables on Linux systems.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Understanding of netfilter architecture
- Managing iptables and nftables
- Configuring default policies
- Writing and deploying effective rules
- Using tables, chains, and rules for both IPv4 and IPv6

## Utilities:
- iptables
- nftables

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Understanding Netfilter Architecture
Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that allows various networking-related operations, such as packet filtering, NAT, and IP masquerading. Tools like iptables and nftables interface with this framework to apply rules to control the flow of network traffic.

### Managing iptables

#### Installation
Ensure `iptables` is installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt-get install iptables
```

#### Viewing Current Rules
To view all current iptables rules:

```bash
sudo iptables -L -v
```

#### Setting Default Policies
Set default policies to DROP for INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains:

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

#### Adding Rules
Allow incoming SSH connections:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

Allow outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
```

### Managing nftables

#### Installation
Ensure `nftables` is installed on your system:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nftables
```

#### Switching to nftables
Stop and disable `iptables`:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop iptables
sudo systemctl disable iptables
```

Enable and start `nftables`:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nftables
sudo systemctl start nftables
```

#### Configuring Tables and Chains
Create a table and basic chains:

```bash
sudo nft add table ip filter
sudo nft add chain ip filter input { type filter hook input priority 0 \; policy drop \; }
sudo nft add chain ip filter forward { type filter hook forward priority 0 \; policy drop \; }
sudo nft add chain ip filter output { type filter hook output priority 0 \; policy drop \; }
```

#### Adding Rules
Allow incoming SSH:

```bash
sudo nft add rule ip filter input ip protocol tcp dport 22 accept
```

Allow HTTP and HTTPS:

```bash
sudo nft add rule ip filter output ip protocol tcp dport 80 accept
sudo nft add rule ip filter output ip protocol tcp dport 443 accept
```

## Conclusion
The ability to configure and manage packet filters using iptables and nftables is essential for maintaining a secure Linux environment. This tutorial provided an introduction to the basic commands and configurations necessary to get started with Linux packet filtering. Both iptables and nftables offer powerful tools for securing your network by precisely defining which packets are allowed to enter or leave the system. By mastering these tools, you can significantly enhance the security posture of your Linux systems.
