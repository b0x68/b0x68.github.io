# Tech Tutorial: 351.2 Xen (weight: 3)

## Introduction

Xen is a powerful, open-source virtualization technology that allows multiple operating systems to run on the same physical hardware concurrently. It is widely used for server virtualization, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) platforms, and for testing and development purposes. In this tutorial, we will explore key aspects of managing and using Xen, focusing on commands and utilities involved in configuring and maintaining Xen virtual machines.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Xen configuration files
- Xen tools
- Managing Xen with xm/xl
- Networking for Xen domains
- Troubleshooting Xen installations

## Utilities:

- xm
- xl
- xenstore
- xen-create-image
- xentop

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Installation

Before diving into the commands and utilities, ensure Xen is installed on your system. Xen typically runs on Linux distributions such as CentOS and Debian. Here's a quick guide to install Xen on a CentOS system:

```bash
sudo yum install centos-release-xen
sudo yum install xen
sudo systemctl enable xen-qemu-dom0-disk-backend.service
sudo systemctl enable xen-init-dom0.service
sudo systemctl enable xenconsoled.service
sudo systemctl start xen-qemu-dom0-disk-backend.service
sudo systemctl start xen-init-dom0.service
sudo systemctl start xenconsoled.service
```

### 2. Creating Virtual Machines with xen-create-image

`xen-create-image` is a tool for creating Xen domainU images. Hereâ€™s how you can create a new virtual machine:

```bash
sudo xen-create-image --hostname=myvm1 --size=10Gb --swap=512Mb --memory=1024Mb --arch=amd64 --dist=buster --network=dhcp
```

This command will create a new virtual machine named `myvm1` with 10GB of disk, 512MB of swap, 1GB of memory, using the Debian Buster distribution, and configured to obtain an IP via DHCP.

### 3. Managing Domains with xl

The `xl` tool is the successor to the older `xm` and is used to manage Xen domains:

- **List all running domains:**

  ```bash
  sudo xl list
  ```

- **Create a domain:**

  ```bash
  sudo xl create /etc/xen/myvm1.cfg
  ```

- **Pause a domain:**

  ```bash
  sudo xl pause myvm1
  ```

- **Unpause a domain:**

  ```bash
  sudo xl unpause myvm1
  ```

- **Shutdown a domain:**

  ```bash
  sudo xl shutdown myvm1
  ```

- **Destroy a domain (force shutdown):**

  ```bash
  sudo xl destroy myvm1
  ```

### 4. Monitoring with xentop

`xentop` displays real-time information about the Xen system and domains. Simply enter:

```bash
sudo xentop
```

This tool will show CPU usage, memory usage, and other important metrics for all running domains.

### 5. Using xenstore

`xenstore` is used for accessing the XenStore, a database shared between domains:

- **List all keys:**

  ```bash
  sudo xenstore-ls
  ```

- **Read a key:**

  ```bash
  sudo xenstore-read vm/myvm1/name
  ```

- **Write a key:**

  ```bash
  sudo xenstore-write vm/myvm1/name "New VM Name"
  ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered basic yet essential commands and utilities to manage Xen virtual environments. From installing Xen, creating virtual machines, managing them using `xl`, monitoring with `xentop`, and using `xenstore` for XenStore interactions, these operations form the backbone of effective Xen administration. Mastery of these tools will allow you to efficiently manage and troubleshoot Xen virtual machines, ensuring robust virtualization environments.
