# Tech Tutorial: 351.3 QEMU (weight: 4)

## Exam Objective:

The main focus of this tutorial is to understand and utilize QEMU, a powerful hardware virtualization and machine emulation software. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to set up, configure, and manage virtual machines using QEMU.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding QEMU architecture and modes (system emulation, user-level emulation).
- Installation of QEMU.
- Basic QEMU commands and usage.
- Networking in QEMU.
- Managing virtual disks and devices.

## Utilities:

- `qemu-img`
- `qemu-system-x86_64`
- `qemu-nbd`

## Introduction

QEMU (Quick EMUlator) is a versatile emulator and virtualizer that allows users to run programs and operating systems designed for different architectures on their machines. It can operate in two modes: as a system emulator or a user-level emulator, providing flexibility depending on the user's requirements.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Installation

QEMU can be installed from the package repositories of most Linux distributions. Here is how you can install it on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
```

### Basic QEMU Commands and Usage

#### 1. Creating a Virtual Disk Image
To create a new virtual disk image, `qemu-img` is used. Here's how to create a 10 GB qcow2 image:

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-disk.img 10G
```

#### 2. Starting a Virtual Machine
To start a virtual machine using `qemu-system-x86_64`, you need to specify the disk image and installation media:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda ubuntu-disk.img -cdrom ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso -m 2048 -boot d
```

This command starts a VM with the following specifications:
- `hda ubuntu-disk.img`: Uses `ubuntu-disk.img` as the hard drive.
- `cdrom ubuntu-20.04-desktop-amd64.iso`: Boots from the provided Ubuntu ISO.
- `m 2048`: Allocates 2048 MB of memory.
- `boot d`: Boots from the CD-ROM drive.

### Networking in QEMU

Networking can be setup using different modes in QEMU. A simple user-network setup is as follows:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda ubuntu-disk.img -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -net nic
```

This command sets up:
- A user-mode network stack.
- Port forwarding from host's port 2222 to the virtual machine's port 22 (SSH).

### Managing Virtual Disks and Devices

#### 1. Modifying Disk Image Size
To resize a disk image:

```bash
qemu-img resize ubuntu-disk.img +5G
```

This command increases the size of `ubuntu-disk.img` by 5 GB.

#### 2. Converting Disk Image Formats
To convert an image file from raw to qcow2 format:

```bash
qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 original.img converted.qcow2
```

### Detailed Code Examples

#### Using `qemu-nbd` to Access Disk Images

To access and modify the contents of a QEMU disk image from the host system, you can use the network block device (NBD) feature:

```bash
sudo modprobe nbd max_part=8
sudo qemu-nbd -c /dev/nbd0 ubuntu-disk.img
sudo mount /dev/nbd0p1 /mnt
# Now you can access the filesystem to perform operations
sudo umount /mnt
sudo qemu-nbd -d /dev/nbd0
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provided an overview and detailed instructions on how to use QEMU for system emulation, including the setup of virtual machines, disk management, and networking. With these skills, you can leverage QEMU to test software across different configurations and operating systems, or even build and test network applications in a controlled environment. Remember, QEMU's capabilities are vast, and this tutorial just scratches the surface. Experimenting with its options and features will give you a deeper understanding and more advanced usage scenarios.
