# Tech Tutorial: 352.2 LXC (weight: 6)

## Introduction

Linux Containers (LXC) are a lightweight virtualization technology. They run multiple, isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single Linux control host. LXC combines the kernel's cgroups and support for isolated namespaces to provide an isolated environment for applications. Understanding LXC is essential for system administrators looking to improve the density and efficiency of their environments.

In this tutorial, we'll cover the key knowledge areas required for managing LXC, including the creation, management, and maintenance of Linux containers.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- LXC installation and configuration
- Basic LXC administration
- Networking for LXC
- Storage for LXC
- Cgroups

## Utilities:

- lxc-create
- lxc-start
- lxc-stop
- lxc-destroy
- lxc-ls
- lxc-info
- lxc-attach
- lxc-console

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Setting Up Your Environment

Before diving into the creation and management of containers, you must install LXC on your system. We'll use Ubuntu as the host operating system for this tutorial.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lxc lxc-templates
```

#### Verify Installation

Check if LXC is installed properly by checking its version:

```bash
lxc --version
```

### Creating a Container

To create a new container using one of the available templates (e.g., Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo lxc-create -n mycontainer -t ubuntu
```

Here, `-n` specifies the name of the container, and `-t` specifies the template.

### Starting the Container

To start the container:

```bash
sudo lxc-start -n mycontainer
```

### Listing Containers

To list all containers:

```bash
sudo lxc-ls --fancy
```

This command provides detailed status of each container.

### Container Information

To get detailed information about a specific container:

```bash
sudo lxc-info -n mycontainer
```

### Stopping a Container

To stop a running container:

```bash
sudo lxc-stop -n mycontainer
```

### Attaching to a Container

To attach to a container’s console:

```bash
sudo lxc-attach -n mycontainer
```

### Accessing Container Console

To access the console of a container:

```bash
sudo lxc-console -n mycontainer
```

To exit the console, use the shortcut `Ctrl+A Q`.

### Destroying a Container

To completely remove a container:

```bash
sudo lxc-destroy -n mycontainer
```

### Managing Container Networking

LXC allows various networking setups. Here’s how to set up a bridged network which allows the container to connect through the host’s network:

1. Install bridge utilities:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install bridge-utils
   ```

2. Configure a bridge in `/etc/network/interfaces`:

   ```plaintext
   auto br0
   iface br0 inet dhcp
       bridge_ports eth0
   ```

3. Restart the network service:

   ```bash
   sudo service networking restart
   ```

4. Configure the container’s network by editing the config at `/var/lib/lxc/mycontainer/config`:

   ```plaintext
   lxc.network.type = veth
   lxc.network.link = br0
   lxc.network.flags = up
   lxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx
   ```

### Managing Storage

LXC supports various storage backends. To set up a separate storage for a container using LVM:

1. Create a logical volume:

   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -n mycontainer-root -L 10G vg0
   ```

2. Attach the volume to the container by adding the following to the container’s config:

   ```plaintext
   lxc.rootfs = /dev/vg0/mycontainer-root
   lxc.rootfs.backend = lvm
   ```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered how to install, configure, and manage Linux Containers using LXC. By following the steps outlined, you can effectively create, manage, and destroy containers, set up networking, and manage storage for your containers. This setup enhances the deployment of isolated and secure application environments within a single host, leveraging the lightweight and fast nature of LXC.

Understanding and using LXC effectively can significantly optimize resource utilization and operational efficiency in many IT environments, particularly those requiring rapid provisioning and scalable solutions.
