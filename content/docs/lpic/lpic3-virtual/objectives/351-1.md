# Tech Tutorial: 351.1 Virtualization Concepts and Theory (weight: 6)

## Introduction

In today's IT landscape, virtualization is a critical technology that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server, leading to better resource utilization and flexibility. Understanding virtualization is imperative for system administrators, especially when preparing for Linux certification exams, such as those offered by the Linux Professional Institute (LPI). This tutorial aims to delve into the core virtualization concepts and theories, explaining their practical implementations and configurations.

## Key Knowledge Areas:
- Types of Virtualization
- Hypervisors
- Virtualization vs Containerization
- Benefits and limitations of virtualization

## Utilities:
- KVM
- QEMU
- libvirt

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding Types of Virtualization

#### a. Full Virtualization
Using a hypervisor, such as KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), full virtualization simulates enough hardware to allow an unmodified "guest" OS to be run in isolation.

```bash
# Install KVM
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils
```

#### b. Paravirtualization
In paravirtualization, the guest OS is aware of the hypervisor and works with it directly for better performance. Xen is a common example.

#### c. OS-level Virtualization
This involves containerization where, unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel. Docker is a popular example.

### 2. Hypervisors

#### a. Type 1 (Bare Metal)
These hypervisors run directly on the hardware. Example: Xen, KVM.

```bash
# Example: Installing Xen Hypervisor
sudo apt-get install xen-hypervisor-amd64
```

#### b. Type 2 (Hosted)
These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system. Example: VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox.

```bash
# Example: Installing VirtualBox on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install virtualbox
```

### 3. Virtualization vs Containerization

Understanding the difference between virtualization and containerization is crucial:

- **Virtualization** allows multiple OS environments to coexist on the same hardware, completely isolated from each other.
- **Containerization** shares the host OS kernel, and separates applications at the process level.

### 4. Benefits and Limitations of Virtualization

#### Benefits
- Isolation
- Utilization
- Scalability

#### Limitations
- Overhead
- Cost
- Complexity

### 5. Practical Implementation Using KVM, QEMU, and libvirt

#### a. Setting up KVM

Check if your CPU supports hardware virtualization:

```bash
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

Install necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients bridge-utils virt-manager
```

#### b. Creating a Virtual Machine with QEMU

Create a disk image:

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-server.qcow2 20G
```

Install an OS from an ISO file:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda ubuntu-server.qcow2 -cdrom ubuntu-20.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso -m 2048 -boot d
```

#### c. Managing Virtual Machines with libvirt

Install libvirt and tools:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-clients
```

Start and enable libvirt:

```bash
sudo systemctl start libvirtd
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
```

List all virtual networks:

```bash
virsh net-list --all
```

### Conclusion

This guide has introduced the fundamental aspects of virtualization, diving into types of virtualization, understanding hypervisors, and distinguishing between virtualization and containerization. With practical examples using KVM, QEMU, and libvirt, you should now have a basic understanding of setting up and managing virtual environments. Virtualization is a vast field, and continuous learning and experimentation are key to mastering it.
