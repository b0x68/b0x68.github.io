# Tech Tutorial: 353.2 Packer (weight: 2)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into using Packer, a powerful open-source tool designed for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is widely used in infrastructure as code environments, facilitating continuous delivery and versioning of images. It can automate the creation of various machine image formats for platforms like AWS EC2, VMware, Docker, and more.

## Exam Objective:

- Understand and use Packer for automating machine image creation.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Packer installation and configuration
- Writing Packer templates
- Building images
- Provisioners and post-processors

## Utilities:

- `packer`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installing Packer

Packer is easy to install. You can download a precompiled binary from its official website or use a package manager. For Linux systems:

```bash
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.7.8/packer_1.7.8_linux_amd64.zip
unzip packer_1.7.8_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv packer /usr/local/bin
```

Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
packer version
```

### Step 2: Writing Your First Packer Template

Packer uses JSON or HCL2 (HashiCorp Configuration Language) for its template. Here, we'll use JSON for simplicity. Create a file named `example.json`:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "ubuntu",
      "commit": true
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "apt-get update",
        "apt-get install -y nginx"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This basic template defines a single builder (Docker) and a provisioner that installs Nginx on an Ubuntu image.

### Step 3: Building an Image with Packer

To build the image as defined in your template, run:

```bash
packer build example.json
```

Packer will execute the defined steps, creating a Docker container, running the provisioner scripts, and committing the changes to form a new Docker image.

### Step 4: Advanced Configuration

Let's explore a more advanced template that builds an AWS AMI:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE",
      "secret_key": "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "source_ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "packer-example {{timestamp}}"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": [
        "sudo apt-get update",
        "sudo apt-get install -y apache2"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration will create a new AWS AMI with Apache installed.

## Detailed Code Examples

### Example: Provisioners

Packer supports multiple types of provisioners. Here's an example using a file provisioner to copy files to the image:

```json
"provisioners": [
  {
    "type": "file",
    "source": "./mywebsite",
    "destination": "/var/www/html"
  },
  {
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "systemctl restart apache2"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Example: Post-Processors

Post-processors are used to process images after they are built. For instance, compressing an output artifact:

```json
"post-processors": [
  {
    "type": "compress",
    "output": "build/{{.BuildName}}.tar.gz",
    "compression_level": 9,
    "keep_input_artifact": true
  }
]
```

## Conclusion

Packer is an incredibly powerful tool for automating the creation of machine images across multiple platforms. By understanding the basics of its configuration and operation, as demonstrated in this tutorial, you can integrate Packer into your infrastructure to ensure consistency, repeatability, and automation in your deployments. Whether you're working with cloud providers like AWS or virtualization platforms like VMware, Packer streamlines the process of image creation and management, making it an essential tool in modern DevOps practices.
