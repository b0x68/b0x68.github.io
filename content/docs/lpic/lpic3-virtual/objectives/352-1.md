# Tech Tutorial: 352.1 Container Virtualization Concepts (weight: 7)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the concept of container virtualization, focusing on Docker, which is one of the most popular containerization platforms. Container virtualization allows developers to package applications with all of their dependencies into a container that can run on any Linux machine. This ensures consistency across environments, simplifies development, and enhances scalability and isolation.

### Exam Objective:

- Understand and identify what container virtualization is
- Understand the role and implementation of Docker
- Manage containers and images using Docker

### Key Knowledge Areas:

- Basic concepts of containerization
- Differences between containers and virtual machines
- Docker installation and configuration
- Managing Docker containers
- Managing Docker images

### Utilities:

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Docker Installation

First, ensure your system is ready to install Docker. We'll be using Ubuntu for this example:

1. **Update your package index**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. **Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key**:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. **Set up the stable repository**:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. **Install Docker CE**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce
   ```

6. **Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly** by running the hello-world image:
   ```bash
   sudo docker run hello-world
   ```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints an informational message and exits.

### Managing Docker Containers

#### Running a container:

- **Run an interactive Ubuntu container**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
  ```

- **List running containers**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker ps
  ```

- **List all containers (running and stopped)**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker ps -a
  ```

#### Stopping and starting containers:

- **Stop a container**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]
  ```

- **Start a stopped container**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker start [CONTAINER_ID]
  ```

### Managing Docker Images

#### Working with images:

- **Pull an image from Docker Hub**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker pull nginx
  ```

- **List all images on the local system**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker images
  ```

- **Remove an image**:
  ```bash
  sudo docker rmi [IMAGE_ID]
  ```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies the deployment of multi-container applications.

- **Install Docker Compose**:
  ```bash
  sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  ```

- **Run a Docker Compose file**:
  ```yaml
  # docker-compose.yml
  version: '3'
  services:
    web:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
    database:
      image: postgres
      environment:
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
  ```

  ```bash
  sudo docker-compose up
  ```

## Conclusion

Container virtualization with Docker provides a powerful, efficient, and scalable way to deploy and manage applications. By encapsulating applications and their environments into containers, Docker allows for portable and consistent behavior across different platforms and development stages. Learning how to effectively use Docker commands and understanding container concepts are crucial skills for developers and system administrators in today's IT landscape.
