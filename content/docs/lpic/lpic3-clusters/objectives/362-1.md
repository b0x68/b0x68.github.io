# Tech Tutorial: 362.1 DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device)

## Introduction

DRBD, or Distributed Replicated Block Device, is a software-based, shared-nothing, replicated storage solution for mirroring the content of block devices (such as hard disks, partitions, logical volumes, etc.) between servers. It is commonly used in high-availability (HA) clusters to ensure data redundancy and consistency across networked computers.

In this tutorial, we will cover the essential aspects of setting up and managing a DRBD environment as part of the preparation for the Linux Professional Institute Certification (LPIC) exam objective 362.1. We will go through installation, configuration, management, and troubleshooting of DRBD.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Installation and configuration of DRBD
- Understanding of DRBD resources, states, and configuration files
- Management and monitoring of DRBD devices
- Basic troubleshooting of DRBD setups

## Utilities:

- `drbdadm`
- `drbdsetup`
- `drbdmeta`

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you have two Linux servers with connectivity between them and that you have superuser privileges on both. The examples use CentOS 7, but similar steps can be applied to other Linux distributions.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Installation

First, you need to install DRBD on both nodes. On RHEL/CentOS-based systems, you can use the EPEL repository:

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install drbd83-utils kmod-drbd83
```

For Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install drbd-utils
```

### Step 2: Configuring DRBD

Create a DRBD configuration file. Hereâ€™s an example configuration for a resource named `r0`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/drbd.d/r0.res
```

Insert the following configuration:

```config
resource r0 {
  protocol C;

  on primary {
    device /dev/drbd0;
    disk /dev/sda7;
    address 192.168.1.1:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
  }

  on secondary {
    device /dev/drbd0;
    disk /dev/sda7;
    address 192.168.1.2:7788;
    meta-disk internal;
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Initialize DRBD Metadata

On both nodes, you need to create DRBD metadata on the configured devices:

```bash
sudo drbdadm create-md r0
```

Output will confirm that metadata was successfully created.

### Step 4: Starting DRBD

Start DRBD on both nodes:

```bash
sudo drbdadm up r0
```

### Step 5: Initial Device Synchronization

Choose one node to be the primary node. Only on the primary node, run:

```bash
sudo drbdadm primary --force r0
```

This sets the device to primary mode and starts synchronization. Check the synchronization status:

```bash
sudo cat /proc/drbd
```

### Step 6: Using the DRBD Device

Once synchronized, you can create a filesystem on the DRBD device on the primary node:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/drbd0
```

Mount the filesystem:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/drbd0 /mnt
```

### Step 7: Managing DRBD

To adjust the DRBD device or to switch roles, use `drbdadm`. For example, to demote the primary to secondary:

```bash
sudo drbdadm secondary r0
```

To promote a secondary to primary:

```bash
sudo drbdadm primary r0
```

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

Check the status of DRBD:

```bash
sudo drbdadm status
```

In case of issues, consult the DRBD logs typically located in `/var/log/messages` or use `dmesg`:

```bash
dmesg | grep drbd
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to set up and manage a basic DRBD environment. DRBD is a powerful tool for data replication and is crucial in creating high-availability clusters. With understanding and practice, you can implement DRBD in production environments to ensure data safety and service availability.
