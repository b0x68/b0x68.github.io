# Tech Tutorial: 364.2 Advanced RAID (weight: 2)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the Advanced RAID configurations and management techniques, which are essential for anyone looking to ensure data redundancy and performance improvement in a network of drives. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) allows you to combine multiple physical disks into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement, or both.

## Exam Objective

The objective of this section is to cover the creation, management, and recovery of RAID devices using Linux utilities.

### Key Knowledge Areas:
- Understanding different RAID levels (0, 1, 5, 6, 10)
- Creating RAID arrays
- Managing RAID arrays
- Monitoring RAID arrays
- Troubleshooting and recovering RAID arrays

### Utilities:
- mdadm
- /proc/mdstat

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understanding RAID Levels

Before we dive into the practical implementations, it's crucial to understand the different RAID levels:

- **RAID 0 (Striping)**: Improves performance but offers no redundancy.
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Provides redundancy by duplicating the same data on two disks.
- **RAID 5 (Striping with parity)**: Data and parity (redundancy data) are striped across three or more disks.
- **RAID 6 (Striping with double parity)**: Similar to RAID 5, but with extra parity to allow survival of two disk failures.
- **RAID 10 (Nested RAID)**: Combines RAID 1 and RAID 0 for both redundancy and performance.

### 2. Creating RAID Arrays

To create a RAID array, the `mdadm` utility is used. Here's how you can create different types of RAID arrays.

#### Creating a RAID 0 Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
```

#### Creating a RAID 1 Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2
```

#### Creating a RAID 5 Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md2 --level=5 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc3 /dev/sdd3
```

#### Creating a RAID 6 Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md3 --level=6 --raid-devices=5 /dev/sda4 /dev/sdb4 /dev/sdc4 /dev/sdd4 /dev/sde4
```

#### Creating a RAID 10 Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md4 --level=10 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sda5 /dev/sdb5 /dev/sdc5 /dev/sdd5
```

### 3. Managing RAID Arrays

#### Viewing RAID Array Status

```bash
cat /proc/mdstat
```

#### Adding a Spare Disk to an Array

```bash
sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sde1
```

#### Removing a Disk from an Array

```bash
sudo mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sde1 --remove /dev/sde1
```

### 4. Monitoring RAID Arrays

To monitor the state of your RAID arrays continuously, `mdadm` can be configured to send email alerts or can be monitored through system logs.

#### Configuring Email Alerts

```bash
sudo mdadm --monitor --mail-alert user@example.com --scan --test /dev/md0
```

### 5. Troubleshooting and Recovering RAID Arrays

#### Simulating a Disk Failure

```bash
sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --fail /dev/sdc3
```

#### Replacing a Failed Disk

```bash
sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --remove /dev/sdc3
sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md2 --add /dev/sdf3
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and managing RAID configurations is crucial for system administrators to ensure data integrity and system performance. The `mdadm` tool is incredibly powerful for creating, managing, and troubleshooting RAID arrays in Linux. Regular monitoring and timely maintenance can help in avoiding data loss and ensure system reliability. This tutorial covered the essential commands and procedures involved in managing RAID arrays, and with this knowledge, you should be able to handle most RAID-related tasks in a Linux environment.
