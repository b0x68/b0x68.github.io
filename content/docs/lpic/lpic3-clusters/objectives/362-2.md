# Tech Tutorial: 362.2 Cluster Storage Access (weight: 3)

## Introduction

In modern computing environments, where data availability and scalability are crucial, clustering technology plays an essential role. Cluster storage access is a critical component in managing and maintaining data across different nodes in a cluster, ensuring data is available and consistent. This tutorial will cover the key areas and utilities necessary for effective cluster storage access, focusing on Linux environments.

## Exam Objective

The objective of this section is to understand how to manage and access storage within a cluster, including the configuration and management of shared storage and distributed file systems.

## Key Knowledge Areas

- Understanding of shared storage technologies (iSCSI, Fibre Channel)
- Configuration and management of GFS2 file systems
- Awareness of distributed storage solutions (Ceph, GlusterFS)

## Utilities

- `iscsiadm`
- `multipath`
- `pcs`
- `parted`
- `mkfs.gfs2`
- `mount`
- `ceph`
- `gluster`

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Configuring iSCSI Initiator

The iSCSI protocol allows block-level data storage over IP networks. Here’s how you can configure an iSCSI initiator on a Linux system:

#### Install the necessary tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install open-iscsi
```

#### Discover targets:
```bash
sudo iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p [target_IP]
```

#### Connect to a target:
```bash
sudo iscsiadm -m node -T [target_name] -p [target_IP] -l
```

### 2. Setting Up Device Multipathing

Device multipathing ensures continuous data access even if one path fails. Here’s how to set it up:

#### Install `multipath-tools`:
```bash
sudo apt-get install multipath-tools
```

#### Configure multipath:
Edit `/etc/multipath.conf` to set up aliases and blacklist non-multipath devices.

#### Start the multipath daemon:
```bash
sudo service multipath-tools restart
```

#### List and manage paths:
```bash
multipath -ll
```

### 3. Managing GFS2 File System

GFS2 is a shared disk file system for Linux used in clusters.

#### Install GFS2 tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gfs2-utils
```

#### Create a GFS2 file system:
```bash
sudo mkfs.gfs2 -p lock_dlm -t mycluster:mygfs2 -j 2 /dev/mapper/mpathX
```

#### Mount the GFS2 file system:
```bash
sudo mount -t gfs2 -o noatime,nodiratime /dev/mapper/mpathX /mnt/gfs2
```

### 4. Introduction to Ceph and GlusterFS

These are distributed storage systems providing excellent scalability and redundancy.

#### Install Ceph:
```bash
sudo apt install ceph
```

#### Deploy a Ceph Monitor and a Ceph OSD (Object Storage Daemon):
```bash
ceph-deploy new node1 node2 node3
ceph-deploy mon create-initial
ceph-deploy osd create --data /dev/sdb node1
```

#### Install GlusterFS:
```bash
sudo apt-get install glusterfs-server
```

#### Configure a GlusterFS volume:
```bash
sudo gluster volume create gv0 replica 3 node1:/data/gv0 node2:/data/gv0 node3:/data/gv0 force
sudo gluster volume start gv0
```

## Conclusion

Understanding and implementing cluster storage access mechanisms is crucial for managing data in a clustered environment. By using tools and technologies like iSCSI, multipathing, GFS2, Ceph, and GlusterFS, administrators can ensure that storage is both scalable and reliable. This tutorial provides the foundational knowledge and practical examples to help you manage cluster storage effectively.
