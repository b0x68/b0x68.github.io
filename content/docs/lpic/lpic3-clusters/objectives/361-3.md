# Tech Tutorial: 361.3 Failover Clusters (weight: 8)

## Exam Objective:

Candidates should be able to manage and maintain highly available services using failover clusters. This includes the understanding and implementation of high-availability techniques, managing cluster resources, and troubleshooting.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding of clustering and high availability
- Configuration and management of Linux failover clusters
- Resource management in a cluster
- Troubleshooting cluster issues

## Utilities:

- Pacemaker
- Corosync
- pcs (Pacemaker/Corosync configuration system)
- crm_mon

## Introduction

Failover clusters are essential for maintaining high availability in critical applications. They ensure that if one or more nodes in a cluster fail, the services they provide continue running on other nodes with minimal or no downtime. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to set up and manage a failover cluster using popular Linux tools: Pacemaker, Corosync, and pcs.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup

Before we begin, ensure that you have at least two Linux servers (nodes) available for clustering. For this guide, we'll use CentOS 8, but the steps should be similar for other Linux distributions.

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

On both nodes, install the necessary clustering software:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y pacemaker corosync pcs
```

### Step 3: Configure Corosync

Corosync is the messaging layer for the cluster, handling communication between nodes.

1. Authenticate the pcs user across all nodes:

```bash
sudo passwd hacluster
pcs cluster auth node1 node2 -u hacluster -p password --force
```

2. Create and configure the Corosync communication layer:

```bash
pcs cluster setup --name my_cluster node1 node2
pcs cluster start --all
```

### Step 4: Configure Pacemaker

Pacemaker manages the resources and services on the cluster.

1. Check the cluster status:

```bash
pcs status
```

2. Add a resource to the cluster. For example, a simple Dummy resource:

```bash
pcs resource create Dummy ocf:pacemaker:Dummy op monitor interval=30s
```

### Step 5: Manage Cluster Resources

Resource management involves adding, modifying, and deleting resources as needed.

1. To modify a resource, for example, changing its monitoring interval:

```bash
pcs resource update Dummy op monitor interval=20s
```

2. To disable a resource temporarily:

```bash
pcs resource disable Dummy
```

3. To enable it again:

```bash
pcs resource enable Dummy
```

4. To delete a resource:

```bash
pcs resource delete Dummy
```

### Step 6: Troubleshooting Cluster Issues

Use `crm_mon` to monitor cluster status and troubleshoot issues:

```bash
crm_mon -1
```

If there's a problem with a node, you might see it marked as `OFFLINE`. To further investigate, check the Corosync and Pacemaker logs typically found in `/var/log/corosync/corosync.log` and `/var/log/pacemaker/pacemaker.log`.

## Conclusion

Setting up a failover cluster on Linux with Pacemaker and Corosync involves several steps from installing necessary packages, configuring Corosync for node communication, setting up Pacemaker for resource management, to managing and troubleshooting the cluster. Properly configured, a failover cluster enhances the reliability and availability of services, critical for business continuity in production environments.

Remember, cluster management can be complex, especially in larger environments. Always test configurations in a controlled setting before applying them in production. Regularly review cluster logs and status to preemptively address potential issues.
