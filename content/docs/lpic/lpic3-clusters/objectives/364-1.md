# Tech Tutorial: 364.1 Hardware and Resource High Availability (weight: 2)

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore the topic of Hardware and Resource High Availability (HA) in depth as it's a crucial component in maintaining the reliability and availability of services in server environments. High Availability refers to the systems or configurations that allow a system to continue functioning for a longer-than-average period of time, typically by reducing downtime and ensuring operational continuity.

The focus will be on Linux environments, where several tools and techniques can be employed to ensure that hardware does not become a single point of failure.

## Key Knowledge Areas:

- Understanding of HA concepts
- Redundancy
- Failover and Fencing
- Resource management and resource groups
- Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP)
- High Availability Linux (Heartbeat, Corosync)

## Utilities:

- pcs
- crm
- corosync
- pacemaker

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. High Availability Concepts

High Availability systems are designed to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period. This is achieved through redundancy and failover solutions.

### 2. Installing High Availability Tools

On most Linux distributions, you can install HA tools like Corosync and Pacemaker from the repository. Hereâ€™s how to install them on a CentOS system:

```bash
sudo yum install pacemaker corosync pcs
```

After installation, it's important to enable and start these services:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable pcsd.service
sudo systemctl enable corosync
sudo systemctl enable pacemaker
sudo systemctl start pcsd.service
sudo systemctl start corosync
sudo systemctl start pacemaker
```

### 3. Authenticating Nodes

Before configuring HA properties, authenticate all nodes in the cluster:

```bash
sudo pcs cluster auth node1 node2 -u hacluster -p password
```

Replace `node1` and `node2` with your actual node names and `password` with the cluster's password.

### 4. Creating and Starting the Cluster

To create and start a cluster with two nodes:

```bash
sudo pcs cluster setup --name my_cluster node1 node2
sudo pcs cluster start --all
```

### 5. Configuring Corosync and Pacemaker

Corosync is used for managing cluster membership whereas Pacemaker is for managing resources:

#### Corosync Configuration:

Usually handled during setup, but you can check the status and configuration with:

```bash
corosync-cfgtool -s
corosync-cmapctl | grep members
```

#### Pacemaker Configuration:

To configure a simple resource (e.g., a virtual IP), use:

```bash
sudo pcs resource create virtual_ip ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=192.168.1.100 cidr_netmask=24 op monitor interval=30s
```

### 6. Managing Cluster Resources and Groups

To manage resources effectively:

```bash
# Check resource status
sudo pcs status resources

# Moving resources
sudo pcs resource move virtual_ip node1

# Removing resource constraints
sudo pcs constraint remove constraint-id
```

### 7. Setting Up Redundancy Using CARP

While CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol) is not commonly used in Linux, similar functionality can be achieved using `keepalived`:

```bash
sudo yum install keepalived
sudo systemctl enable --now keepalived
```

Configuration of `keepalived` can be done in `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the essential aspects of setting up and managing High Availability configurations in Linux using tools like Corosync, Pacemaker, and pcs. High Availability is a complex but crucial area in system administration, ensuring minimal downtime and service reliability. With these configurations, systems are better equipped to handle failures gracefully, thus maintaining service continuity.
