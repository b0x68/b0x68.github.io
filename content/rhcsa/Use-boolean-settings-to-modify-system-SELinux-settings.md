#Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Use boolean settings to modify system SELinux settings

SELinux, or Security-Enhanced Linux, is a mandatory access control (MAC) system implemented in the Linux kernel. It provides an additional layer of security by restricting access to certain system resources based on policies set by the system administrator.

In order to effectively manage SELinux, a system administrator needs to have a thorough understanding of boolean settings. These boolean settings allow for more granular control over SELinux policies, allowing administrators to fine-tune security settings for their system.

In this tutorial, we will explain in depth how to use boolean settings to modify SELinux settings on a Red Hat system.

##What are boolean settings?

Boolean settings, also known as boolean variables, are a type of variable that can only have two possible values: "true" or "false". In the context of SELinux, boolean settings are used to control whether a specific SELinux policy is enforced or not.

By default, SELinux policies are set to "enforcing", meaning they are fully enforced. However, with the use of boolean settings, administrators can change the policy to "permissive" or even disable it completely.

##Enabling and disabling boolean settings

To modify SELinux boolean settings, the `semanage` command is used. This command allows administrators to enable or disable boolean settings, as well as view their current status.

To see a list of all available boolean settings, run the command `semanage boolean -l`. This will output a list of all boolean settings, along with their current status.

To enable a specific boolean setting, use the command `semanage boolean -e <BOOLEAN_NAME>`. Similarly, to disable a setting, use the command `semanage boolean -d <BOOLEAN_NAME>`.

##Modifying SELinux policies using boolean settings

As mentioned earlier, boolean settings allow for more granular control over SELinux policies. This means that instead of enabling or disabling the entire policy, administrators can choose to modify specific policies.

To modify a specific SELinux policy using boolean settings, first, identify the policy that needs to be modified. This can be done by viewing the SELinux logs or by running `audit2why`, which provides a human-readable explanation of the SELinux denials in the system.

Once the policy has been identified, use the `semanage boolean -m` command to modify the policy. For example, if we want to allow Apache to make network connections on our system, we would use the command `semanage boolean -m httpd_can_network_connect`.

##Persisting boolean settings across reboots

By default, any changes made to boolean settings are not persistent and will be lost upon reboot. To make these changes persistent, the `setsebool` command is used.

For example, if we have modified the policy to allow Apache to make network connections, we can make this change persistent by running `setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect on`. The `-P` flag ensures that the change is persistent.

##Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explained in great depth how to use boolean settings to modify SELinux policies on a Red Hat system. We have discussed the purpose of boolean settings, how to enable and disable them, as well as how to modify specific policies using these settings.

It is important for Red Hat Certified Systems Administrators to have a strong understanding of SELinux and boolean settings to effectively manage the security of their systems. With the knowledge and skills gained from this tutorial, you should be well-equipped to tackle any SELinux-related tasks in the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200.
