# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Configure key-based authentication for SSH

SSH (Secure Shell) is a widely used protocol for secure communication over networks. It is used to remotely access and manage systems through a command-line interface. In order to secure this communication, SSH allows authentication using keys instead of passwords. In this tutorial, we will discuss how to configure key-based authentication for SSH on a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system with SSH installed and running.
- Basic knowledge of SSH and command-line interface.

## Step 1: Generate a SSH key pair

The first step in configuring key-based authentication for SSH is to generate a public and private key pair. This can be done with the `ssh-keygen` command.

```
ssh-keygen
```

You will be prompted to enter a file name for the key pair and a passphrase. It is important to choose a strong passphrase to secure your private key. It is also recommended to use a unique file name for your key pair.

After completing this step, you will have a public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) and a private key file (`id_rsa`) in your current directory.

## Step 2: Copy the public key to the remote system

The next step is to copy the public key to the remote system where you want to configure key-based authentication. This can be done using the `ssh-copy-id` command.

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [remote_username]@[remote_system]
```

You will be prompted to enter the password for the remote user. Once the key is copied, the remote system will add the public key to the `authorized_keys` file, which is used for key-based authentication.

## Step 3: Configure SSH to use key-based authentication

Now that the keys are in place, we need to configure SSH on the remote system to use key-based authentication. This can be done by editing the `sshd_config` file.

```
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Find the line `#PubkeyAuthentication yes` and uncomment it by removing the `#` symbol. If the line does not exist, add it to the file.

Next, find the line `#PasswordAuthentication yes` and change `yes` to `no` to disable password authentication. This will ensure that only key-based authentication is allowed.

Save and close the file.

## Step 4: Reload SSH service and test the configuration

To apply the changes made to the `sshd_config` file, we need to reload the SSH service.

```
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

Next, try connecting to the remote system using SSH.

```
ssh [remote_username]@[remote_system]
```

You will be prompted to enter the passphrase for your private key. If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to login without entering a password.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have discussed how to configure key-based authentication for SSH on a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. This method of authentication is more secure than password-based authentication and is widely used in production environments. It is important to regularly update your keys and use strong passphrases to maintain the security of your SSH communication.
