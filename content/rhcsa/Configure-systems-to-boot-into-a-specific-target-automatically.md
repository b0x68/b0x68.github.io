# Introduction to Configuring Systems to Boot into Specific Targets Automatically

As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA), it is essential to understand how to configure systems to boot into specific targets automatically. This objective is vital in ensuring your system is up and running in the desired state after a reboot or power loss. In this tutorial, we will cover the steps required to configure your system to boot into a specific target automatically.

## Understanding System Targets

Before we dive into the steps for configuring system targets, let's first understand what system targets are. A system target is a predefined state or level that your system boots into after starting up. It determines which services, applications, and processes are started during the boot process. It is a crucial aspect of managing your system's startup and performance.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) uses systemd as its system and service manager, which means that all system targets are managed by systemd. There are seven predefined system targets in RHEL, each with a specific purpose:

- **rescue.target:** This target boots your system into a minimal state, without any services or applications, allowing you to troubleshoot and fix issues on your system.
- **emergency.target:** This target boots your system into an even more minimal state than rescue.target, focused on resolving critical system issues.
- **multi-user.target:** This target is the default for RHEL. It boots your system into a multi-user, non-graphical environment.
- **graphical.target:** This target is similar to multi-user.target, but it boots your system into a graphical environment.
- **basic.target:** This target is an intermediate state between multi-user.target and graphical.target. It allows you to boot into a state with minimal services and applications but still have access to a graphical interface.
- **default.target:** This target is the same as multi-user.target and is the most common target used for server deployments.
- **shutdown.target:** This target gracefully shuts down your system.

Knowing the purpose of each system target will help you determine which target is suitable for your system's needs.

## Configuring System Targets

Now that we have a better understanding of system targets, let's learn how to configure them to automatically boot into a specific target.

1. The first step is to identify which target you want your system to boot into automatically. For this tutorial, we will configure our system to boot into the **graphical.target**.

2. Once you have identified the target, you need to edit the **/etc/default/grub** configuration file. This file contains the configuration for the GRUB bootloader, which is responsible for loading the Linux kernel during the boot process.

3. Open the **/etc/default/grub** file using a text editor of your choice. You can do this by running the command `sudo vim /etc/default/grub` in your terminal.

4. In the **/etc/default/grub** file, locate the line that starts with **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX**. This line contains the kernel boot parameters used by GRUB.

5. To configure your system to boot into the **graphical.target**, add the following parameter at the end of the **GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX** line: `systemd.unit=graphical.target`

6. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

7. Next, you need to regenerate the GRUB configuration file by running the command `sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg` in your terminal. This command will use the changes you made in the **/etc/default/grub** file to generate a new GRUB configuration file.

8. The final step is to set your chosen target as the default boot target. You can do this by running the command `sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target` in your terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully configured your system to boot into the **graphical.target** automatically.

## Verifying the Configuration

To verify that your system is now configured to boot into the specified target automatically, you can simply reboot your system. After the reboot, your system should start up into the desired target.

You can also run the command `systemctl get-default` in your terminal to see which target is currently set as the default.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing this tutorial! You have learned about system targets, their purpose, and how to configure your system to boot into a specific target automatically. This knowledge is essential for any Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator and will help you manage and troubleshoot your system more efficiently. We hope this tutorial has been helpful, and we wish you all the best for your RHCSA certification exam. Happy learning!
