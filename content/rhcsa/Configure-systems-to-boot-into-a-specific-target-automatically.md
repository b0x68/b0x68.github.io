# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: "Configure systems to boot into a specific target automatically"

In this tutorial, we will explore the objective of configuring systems to boot into a specific target automatically. This is an important skill for any Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, as it allows for efficient and automated system startup, reducing manual interventions and potential mistakes.

## Understanding System Targets

Before we dive into the steps to configure automatic booting, let's first understand what system targets are. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, a target is a predefined state of services and resources that a system must reach during the boot process or while the system is running. It can be thought of as a set of rules that define what services should be started, stopped or enabled during system startup or while the system is running.

There are primarily two types of targets in Red Hat Enterprise Linux:
- **Multi-user.target:** This is the default target for most system boots and is used for normal system operation. It starts a minimal set of services required for a functional system, such as networking, file systems, and system logging.
- **Graphical.target:** This target is used for systems that have a graphical desktop environment installed. It starts all the services necessary for a functional graphical desktop session.

## Configuring Automatic Booting

Now that we understand system targets, let's go through the steps to configure automatic booting into a specific target.

### Step 1: Identify the Current Default Target

The first step is to identify the current default target on your system. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

```
systemctl get-default
```

The output will show the current default target. It is usually set to `multi-user.target`, but if you have a graphical desktop environment installed, it might be set to `graphical.target`.

### Step 2: List Available Targets

Next, we need to identify which other targets are available on our system. This can be done by running the following command:

```
systemctl list-units --type=target --all
```

This will show a list of all available targets, along with their status (whether they are enabled or disabled).

### Step 3: Set the Default Target

To set the default target, we will use the `systemctl` command again. We can specify which target we want to set as the default using the `set-default` option. For example, if we want to change the default target to `graphical.target`, we would run the following command:

```
systemctl set-default graphical.target
```

### Step 4: Verify the Changes

To ensure that the changes have been applied successfully, we can once again use the `systemctl get-default` command. It should now show the new target as the default.

### Step 5: Test the Changes

It's always a good practice to test any changes we make before implementing them in a production environment. To test the changes, we can reboot our system and see if it boots into the new default target automatically. To reboot, we can use the `reboot` command.

Upon reboot, the system should automatically boot into the new default target that we have set.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned about the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective of configuring systems to boot into a specific target automatically. We discussed what system targets are and the two types of targets available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. We also went through the steps to configure automatic booting, including identifying the current default target, listing all available targets, setting the default target, and testing the changes. By following these steps, you should now have a better understanding of how to configure systems to boot into a specific target automatically.
