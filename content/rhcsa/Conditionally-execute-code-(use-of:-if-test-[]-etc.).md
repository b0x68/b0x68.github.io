# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Conditionally Execute Code

Conditional execution is an important concept in programming and is a key skill that is tested in the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200. The ability to execute code conditionally allows a program to make decisions based on certain conditions, and perform different actions depending on the situation. In this tutorial, we will dive deep into this objective and cover everything you need to know about conditionally executing code.

## What is Conditional Execution?

Conditional execution is a programming technique that allows code to be executed only if a certain condition is true. This condition can be anything from a simple comparison between two variables to a complex expression evaluating multiple conditions. The use of conditional execution saves time and resources by only executing code when it is necessary.

In the RHCSA Exam 200, you will be tested on your ability to use conditional execution in various scenarios using tools such as `if`, `test`, `[]`, and others.

## Using the `if` Statement

The `if` statement is a fundamental component of conditional execution in programming. It allows us to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The structure of an `if` statement is as follows:

```
if [condition]; then
  [code to execute]
fi 
```

Let's break down each element of this structure:

- The `if` keyword marks the beginning of the statement.
- The condition is inside the brackets `[]` and can be any valid expression that evaluates to either true or false.
- The `; then`  signifies the end of the condition and the start of the code block to be executed if the condition is met.
- The `code to execute` can be a single line or multiple lines of code that will be executed only if the condition is true.
- Finally, the `fi` keyword marks the end of the statement.

For example, let's say we have a variable `num` with the value 5. We want to print a message if the value of `num` is equal to 5. We can use the `if` statement to achieve this as follows:

```
if [ $num -eq 5 ]; then
  echo "The value of num is 5"
fi
```

In this example, the condition `[ $num -eq 5 ]` is true, so the code `echo "The value of num is 5"` will be executed and the message will be printed to the screen.

## Using the `test` Command

The `test` command is another tool that is commonly used for conditional execution. It allows us to evaluate a condition and return a true or false value. The basic syntax for the `test` command is:

```
test [condition]
```

Similar to the `if` statement, the condition can be any valid expression that evaluates to true or false. The `test` command will return a 0 exit status if the condition is true and 1 if the condition is false. This can be useful in shell scripts to perform different actions based on the exit status of the `test` command.

Let's modify our previous example using the `test` command instead of the `if` statement:

```
if test $num -eq 5; then
  echo "The value of num is 5"
fi
```

Both approaches will give the same result but it's important to note that the `[]` around the condition are optional when using the `test` command.

## Combining Conditions with `test`

One of the powerful features of `test` is the ability to combine multiple conditions using logical operators such as `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). This allows us to create more complex conditions to control the execution of code.

Let's take a look at an example using the logical AND (`&&`) operator:

```
if test $num -eq 5 && test $mode = "production"; then
  echo "The value of num is 5 and the mode is production"
fi
```

In this example, both conditions must evaluate to true for the code block to be executed.

## Using `test` with Other Commands

Apart from evaluating variables and expressions, the `test` command can also be used in combination with other commands to conditionally execute code. For example, we can use the `test` command to check if a file exists before executing a command that requires the file. The structure for this is:

```
if test -f [file]; then
  [code to execute]
fi
```

Here, the `-f` flag checks if the given file exists and is a regular file. Other useful flags for file testing are `-d` (checks if file is a directory), `-r` (checks for read permission) and `-w` (checks for write permission).

## Using `if` with `elif` and `else` Clauses

The `if` statement can also be extended to include the `elif` and `else` clauses, allowing us to execute different blocks of code depending on multiple conditions. The structure for this is as follows:

```
if [condition 1]; then
  [code to execute if condition 1 is true]
elif [condition 2]; then
  [code to execute if condition 2 is true]
else
  [code to execute if both condition 1 and 2 are false]
fi
``` 

The `elif` clause can be repeated multiple times to handle more conditions, and the `else` clause is optional. If all conditions evaluate to false, the code inside the `else` block will be executed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective of conditionally executing code. We learned about the `if` statement, `test` command, and different ways of combining conditions to control the execution of code. We also touched upon using `else` and `elif` clauses for more complex scenarios. With this knowledge, you should now be well-prepared for this objective in your RHCSA exam.
