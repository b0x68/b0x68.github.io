# Conditional Execution in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam

In this tutorial, we will explain the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200 Objective: "Conditionally execute code". This is an important topic that covers the use of various conditional statements and commands such as if, test, and []; which are essential for automating tasks and managing system resources efficiently.

Before we dive into the specifics of conditional execution, let's first understand its importance in a server environment. As a system administrator, you will often come across situations where you need to execute a set of commands or a script based on certain conditions. This could be anything from checking the status of a service to allocating resources based on system load. Conditional execution allows you to automate these tasks and make your system more efficient.

Now, let's take a closer look at the various components of conditional execution and how they function.

## If Statement

The if statement is a basic conditional statement that allows you to execute a set of commands only if a specific condition is met. Its syntax is as follows:

`if [condition]
then
  [commands]
fi`

If the condition is true, the commands within the 'then' block will be executed. Otherwise, the if statement will be skipped. Let's look at a practical example of this.

Suppose you want to check if a specific service is running on your server. You can use the following if statement:

`if systemctl is-active [service]
then
  echo "Service is running"
fi`

If the specified service is running, the echo command will be executed and you will see the message "Service is running" in the terminal. Otherwise, if the service is not running, the if statement will be skipped, and you will not see any output.

## Test Command

The test command is used to evaluate conditional expressions and is commonly used in combination with the if statement. Its syntax is as follows:

`test [expression]`

If the expression evaluates to true, the test command will return an exit status of zero. Otherwise, if the expression is false, it will return a non-zero exit status. Let's look at some examples of the test command in action.

### Checking File Existence

One use case of the test command is to check if a file exists in a specified location. This can be done using the '-e' flag, which stands for "exist". Here's an example:

`if test -e /home/user/file.txt
then
  echo "File exists"
fi`

If the file "file.txt" exists in the specified location, the echo command will be executed, and you will see the message "File exists" in the terminal. Otherwise, the if statement will be skipped.

### Checking Numeric Values

The test command can also be used to check for numeric values. You can use the flags '-eq', '-ne', '-gt', '-lt', '-ge', and '-le' to compare two numeric values. For example:

`if test 5 -gt 3
then
  echo "5 is greater than 3"
fi`

In this example, the '-gt' flag is used to check if 5 is greater than 3. If it is, the echo command will be executed, and you will see the message "5 is greater than 3" in the terminal.

## Square Brackets [ ]

The square brackets [ ] are used to enclose conditions or expressions, similar to the test command. It is essentially equivalent to the test command, and its use is preferred due to its simplicity. Let's look at some examples:

### Checking File Existence

The -e flag can also be used within square brackets to check for file existence. Here's an example:

`if [ -e /home/user/file.txt ]
then
  echo "File exists"
fi`

This will have the same effect as the previous example using the test command.

### Checking String Values

Apart from numeric values, the square brackets can also be used to compare string values. You can use the equality and inequality operators (= and !=) to compare two strings. For example:

`if [ "Red Hat" = "Red Hat" ]
then
  echo "The strings are equal"
fi`

This example will print the message "The strings are equal" because the strings on either side of the '=' operator are equal. You can also use the '-z' flag to check for an empty string or the '-n' flag to check for a non-empty string.

## Logical Operators

In addition to conditional expressions, conditional execution also involves the use of logical operators to combine multiple conditions. The '&&' (AND) and '||' (OR) operators are commonly used in combination with if statements and square brackets to create complex conditional statements. Let's explore their usage through some examples.

### Combining Conditions with AND Operator

Using the '&&' operator allows you to execute a set of commands only if all the specified conditions evaluate to true. For example:

`if [ -e file1 ] && [ -d directory ]
then
  echo "File exists and directory exists"
fi`

In this example, the '&&' operator is used to combine two conditions. The 'if' statement will only be executed if both conditions are true. If the first condition is false, the second condition will not even be evaluated.

### Combining Conditions with OR Operator

Using the '||' operator allows you to execute a set of commands if any of the specified conditions evaluates to true. For example:

`if [ -e file1 ] || [ -e file2 ]
then
  echo "At least one of the files exists"
fi`

In this example, the '||' operator is used to combine two conditions. The 'if' statement will be executed if either of the conditions is true. If the first condition is true, the second condition will not even be evaluated.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored conditional execution in great depth. We have covered the use and syntax of the if statement, test command, square brackets, and logical operators. These are essential concepts for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200 and will help you in automating tasks and managing system resources efficiently. We hope this tutorial has provided a comprehensive understanding of this topic and will aid you in your preparation for the RHCSA exam. Good luck!
