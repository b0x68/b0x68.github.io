Introduction:

SELinux, or Security-Enhanced Linux, is a mandatory access control (MAC) security mechanism used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) to provide an extra layer of security for the operating system. The Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) exam evaluates candidates' ability to configure and manage SELinux, including setting enforcing and permissive modes. This tutorial will explain in depth how to set these modes for SELinux on RHEL.

Prerequisites:

Before attempting to set enforcing and permissive modes for SELinux, it is important to have a basic understanding of SELinux concepts such as domains, contexts, and policies. It is also essential to have a working knowledge of the terminal and basic command-line syntax.

Step 1: Understanding Enforcing and Permissive Modes:

Before we dive into how to set these modes, let's first understand what enforcing and permissive modes mean for SELinux.

Enforcing mode is the default mode for SELinux and is where all access attempts are actively checked against the SELinux policy. If a user or process attempts to access a resource that is not permitted by the policy, it will be denied and logged. This mode enforces strict security controls and is suitable for production environments.

Permissive mode, on the other hand, is a more lenient mode where access attempts are still checked against the policy, but instead of being denied, they are only logged. This mode is useful for troubleshooting as it allows you to see which actions would be denied if SELinux were in enforcing mode, without actually impacting the system's operations.

Step 2: Checking Current SELinux Mode:

As mentioned earlier, enforcing mode is the default for SELinux. However, it is always good practice to check the current mode before attempting to change it.

To check the current mode, use the "getenforce" command in the terminal. This will return either "Enforcing" or "Permissive" to indicate the current mode. If the output is "Disabled," it means that SELinux is not currently enabled on the system.

Step 3: Changing SELinux Mode:

To set enforcing mode for SELinux, use the command "setenforce 1" in the terminal. Similarly, to set permissive mode, use "setenforce 0." These commands will immediately change the mode for SELinux, but the change will not persist after a system reboot.

Step 4: Setting SELinux Mode Persistently:

To make the mode change for SELinux persistent after a system reboot, we need to modify the SELinux configuration file. This file is located at "/etc/selinux/config" and can be edited using a text editor such as "vi" or "nano."

To set enforcing mode persistently, open the configuration file and change the value of "SELINUX" to "enforcing." To set permissive mode persistently, change the value to "permissive." Once the value is changed, save and exit the file.

Step 5: Reloading SELinux Configuration:

After making changes to the SELinux configuration file, it is necessary to reload the SELinux policy to apply the changes. This can be done by executing the command "load_policy" in the terminal.

Step 6: Checking the Persistence of Mode Changes:

To confirm that the SELinux mode changes have been applied and will persist after a system reboot, use the "getenforce" command again. The output should now show the new mode.

Step 7: Troubleshooting SELinux Mode Changes:

If you encounter issues after changing the SELinux mode, it is essential to troubleshoot and identify the cause. Some common troubleshooting steps include checking the SELinux logs, using the "sestatus" command to view the current SELinux status, and reviewing the SELinux policy to see which actions are being denied.

Conclusion:

In this tutorial, we have learned how to set enforcing and permissive modes for SELinux on RHEL. We also discussed the differences between these modes and how to check the current mode, change it, and make the changes persistent. Remember to always consider the security implications before changing SELinux modes and regularly review logs and policies to maintain a secure and stable system.
