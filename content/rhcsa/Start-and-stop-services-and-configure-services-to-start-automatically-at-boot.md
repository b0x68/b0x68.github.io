# Introduction

Welcome to our tutorial on the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: "Start and stop services and configure services to start automatically at boot." This objective is an important component of the exam as it tests your knowledge and skills in managing services on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. In this tutorial, we will provide in-depth explanations and step-by-step instructions on how to start and stop services and configure them to start automatically at boot.

## What are services?

Before we dive into the specifics of managing services, let's first understand what services are. In simple terms, services are programs or daemons that run in the background and provide specific functionality to the operating system. For example, a web server service provides the functionality of serving web pages, while a network time protocol (NTP) service ensures accurate time synchronization on the system. Services are crucial for the functioning of a Linux system and managing them is a key responsibility of a system administrator.

## Starting and Stopping Services

Now, let's look at the steps to start and stop services on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.

### Starting Services

To start a service, we use the `systemctl start` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to start the apache web server service, we would use the following command:

`systemctl start httpd`

This command will start the service and it will be immediately available for use. You can verify the status of the service by using the `systemctl status` command, which will show whether the service is active or not.

### Stopping Services

To stop a service, we use the `systemctl stop` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to stop the apache web server service, we would use the following command:

`systemctl stop httpd`

This command will stop the service and it will no longer be available. You can also check the status of the service using the `systemctl status` command, which will now show that the service is inactive.

## Configuring Services to Start Automatically at Boot

By default, services do not automatically start when the system is rebooted. We need to configure them to start automatically to ensure that the services are always available. Here are the steps to configure services to start automatically at boot:

1. First, we need to list all the services that are currently configured to start at boot using the `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service` command.
2. Find the service that you want to enable and note down its name (e.g. `httpd.service`).
3. Use the `systemctl enable` command followed by the service name to configure the service to start at boot. For example:

`systemctl enable httpd.service`

4. To verify that the service is now configured to start at boot, use the `systemctl is-enabled` command followed by the service name. The output should show `enabled`.

Congratulations, you have now successfully configured a service to start automatically at boot!

## Bonus Tip: Managing Multiple Services at Once

If you need to start, stop, or enable multiple services at once, you can use the `systemctl` command with the `space` option. For example, to start the apache web server and NTP services, we would use the following command:

`systemctl start httpd ntpd`

This will start both services at once, saving you time and effort.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective of starting and stopping services and configuring them to start automatically at boot. Make sure to practice these steps and explore other service management commands to fully understand this topic. With this knowledge, you will be well-prepared for the exam and more importantly, be able to confidently manage services on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.
