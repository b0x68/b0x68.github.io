#Tutorial: Securely Transfer Files Between Systems

In this tutorial, we will dive into the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective on securely transferring files between systems. We will cover the necessary steps and tools to ensure your file transfers are secure and reliable.

##Step 1: Understanding the Importance of Secure File Transfers

When transferring files between systems, it is crucial to ensure that the files are sent and received securely. This is especially important when dealing with sensitive information or when transferring files over insecure networks. By securing your file transfers, you can prevent unauthorized access to your files and maintain the integrity of the data being transferred.

##Step 2: Setting Up SSH Keys

One of the most common ways to securely transfer files between systems is by using Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. To use this method, you will need to set up SSH keys between the systems you wish to transfer files between. SSH keys provide a secure way of authenticating the connection between two systems without the need for passwords. Here's how to set up SSH keys:

1. On the source system, generate a public-private key pair by using the `ssh-keygen` command. You can choose to specify a passphrase for added security, but this is not mandatory.

2. Copy the public key to the destination system by using the `ssh-copy-id` command. This command will prompt you for the destination system's password. Once completed, the public key will be added to the destination systemâ€™s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

3. Repeat the same process on the destination system, generating a public-private key pair and copying the public key to the source system.

##Step 3: Using Secure Copy (SCP) for File Transfers

Once the SSH keys have been set up, you can use the `scp` command to securely transfer files between systems. SCP is a secure version of the `cp` command that allows you to copy files over SSH connections.

To transfer a file from the source system to the destination system, use the following command:

`scp <filename> <username>@<destination_system>:/<destination_directory>`

For example:

`scp test.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/files`

This command will copy the test.txt file to the /home/user/files directory on the destination system. You will be prompted for the destination system's password only if you did not set up SSH keys.

To transfer a file from the destination system to the source system, simply reverse the command, like this:

`scp <username>@<source_system>:/<source_directory>/<filename> .`

For example:

`scp user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/files/test.txt .`

This command will copy the test.txt file from the /home/user/files directory on the destination system to your current working directory on the source system.

##Step 4: Using SFTP for Secure File Transfers

Another option for secure file transfers between systems is to use Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). This protocol provides a secure method for file transfers over SSH connections. To use SFTP, follow these steps:

1. On the source system, navigate to the directory that contains the file you want to transfer.

2. Open a new terminal window and connect to the destination system using the `sftp` command:

`sftp <username>@<destination_system>`

For example:

`sftp user@192.168.1.100`

3. You will be prompted for the destination system's password. Once connected, you will see a `sftp>` prompt.

4. Use the `put` command to transfer the file from the source system to the destination system:

`sftp> put <filename>`

For example:

`sftp> put test.txt`

This will transfer the test.txt file to the current working directory on the destination system.

5. To transfer a file from the destination system to the source system, use the `get` command:

`sftp> get <filename>`

For example:

`sftp> get test.txt`

This will transfer the test.txt file from the current working directory on the destination system to your current working directory on the source system.

##Step 5: Enabling FTPS for Secure File Transfers

If you prefer to use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for file transfers, you can still do so securely by using FTPS, which is FTP over SSL. FTPS encrypts the data and authentication information, making it a secure option for transferring files between systems.

To enable FTPS on both the source and destination systems, you will need to install and configure an FTPS server, such as vsftpd.

1. Install vsftpd on both the source and destination systems.

2. Configure vsftpd by enabling SSL encryption and setting up user login credentials for FTPS connections.

3. Open port 990 for FTPS connections on both systems.

4. Connect to the destination system from the source system using an FTPS client, such as FileZilla.

5. Use your FTPS login credentials to securely transfer files between systems.

##Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the necessary steps and tools to securely transfer files between systems. By setting up SSH keys, using SCP and SFTP, or enabling FTPS, you can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of your file transfers. With your newfound knowledge, you can confidently tackle the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective on securely transferring files between systems.
