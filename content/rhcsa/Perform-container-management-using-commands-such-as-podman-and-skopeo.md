# Tutorial: Container Management using Podman and Skopeo

In order to become a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, it is essential to understand how to manage containers using commands such as Podman and Skopeo. These tools are used to build, manage, and deploy containers, making them an integral part of any administrator’s skillset. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive overview of container management using Podman and Skopeo, covering the key concepts and commands needed in the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator exam.

## What are containers?

Before diving into container management, it is important to understand what containers are and why they are used. Containers are lightweight, standalone and executable packages of software that include all the necessary components to run an application efficiently. They are designed to be portable and easily deployable across different environments.

## Why use Podman and Skopeo?

Podman and Skopeo are two popular tools used for managing containers in the Red Hat ecosystem. Podman is a daemon-less container engine used to run, build, and manage containers without needing a background service. This makes it lightweight and secure, as containers are run without any privileged access. On the other hand, Skopeo is a tool used for inspecting, copying, and managing container images. It allows administrators to easily transfer and distribute container images across different environments. These tools are used extensively in Red Hat environments as they provide a secure and efficient way to manage containers.

## Installing Podman and Skopeo

Before starting to manage containers using Podman and Skopeo, you will need to install them. These tools are usually included in the latest Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version, but they can also be installed on other operating systems such as CentOS or Fedora. Follow the steps below to install Podman and Skopeo:

1. Update your system’s package index to ensure you have the latest versions of the packages: 

`$ sudo yum update`

2. To install Podman, run the following command: 

`$ sudo yum install podman`

3. To install Skopeo, run the following command: 

`$ sudo yum install skopeo`

## Using Podman for container management

Once installed, Podman can be used to manage containers in the following categories:

#### 1. Building Containers

Podman allows administrators to build containers using Dockerfiles. 

1. Create a new directory for your project:  

`$ mkdir my_container`

2. Navigate to the project directory and create a file named Dockerfile: 

`$ cd my_container`
    
`$ touch Dockerfile`

3. Populate the Dockerfile with the necessary instructions such as specifying the base image, installing packages, and setting environment variables.

4. Use the `podman build` command to build the container from the Dockerfile: 

`$ podman build -t my_container_image .`

This will create a new container image that can be stored and deployed.

#### 2. Running Containers

Podman allows administrators to run containers in detached mode or interactively.

1. To run a container in detached mode, use the `podman run` command with the `-d` flag:

`$ podman run -d my_container_image`

This will run the container in the background and provide a container ID.

2. To run a container interactively, use the `podman run` command without the `-d` flag: 

`$ podman run -it my_container_image bash`

This will run the container and place you inside its shell.

#### 3. Managing Containers

Podman also allows administrators to stop, restart, and delete containers using the `podman stop`, `podman restart`, and `podman rm` commands respectively. 

1. To stop a container, use the `podman stop` command with the container’s ID:

`$ podman stop [container_id]`

2. To restart a container, use the `podman restart` command with the container’s ID:

`$ podman restart [container_id]`

3. To delete a container, use the `podman rm` command with the container’s ID:

`$ podman rm [container_id]`

#### 4. Managing Container Networks

Podman allows administrators to manage container networks, which are used for communication between containers or between containers and the host. 

1. Use the `podman network create` command to create a new network:

`$ podman network create my_network`

2. To attach a container to a network, use the `podman network connect` command with the container’s ID and the network’s name:

`$ podman network connect my_network [container_id]`

3. To inspect the IP address allocated to a container in a specific network, use the `podman inspect` command:

`$ podman inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.my_network.IP Address}}' [container_id]`

## Using Skopeo for container management

Skopeo is used to manage container images, including inspecting, copying, and managing their distribution. 

#### 1. Inspecting Container Images

The `skopeo inspect` command can be used to view detailed information about a container image:

`$ skopeo inspect docker://ubuntu:latest`

This will show information such as the image’s layers, exposed ports, and environment variables.

#### 2. Copying Container Images

To copy a container image from one registry to another, the `skopeo copy` command is used:

`$ skopeo copy docker://registry1/image:tag docker://registry2/image:tag`

This will copy the image’s manifest and all its layers to the new registry.

#### 3. Translating Container Images 

Skopeo also allows administrators to translate container images between different types of registries using the `skopeo copy` command. For example, the command below translates a container image from a Docker registry format to an OCI (Open Container Initiative) registry format:

`$ skopeo copy docker://registry1/image:tag oci://registry2/image:tag`

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the key concepts and commands needed to manage containers using Podman and Skopeo. These tools are essential for any Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, as they provide a secure and efficient way to build, run, and manage containers. Practice using these tools in a sandbox environment to become more familiar with their functionalities and prepare for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator exam.
