# Tutorial: How to Modify the System Bootloader 

The system bootloader is an essential component of any operating system, including Red Hat Linux. It is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on and is responsible for loading the operating system into memory. As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, it is crucial to understand how to modify the system bootloader to troubleshoot and configure a system.

In this tutorial, we will go through the steps of modifying the system bootloader in depth, focusing specifically on the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective: "Modify the system bootloader." 

## Step 1: Understanding the Bootloader
Before diving into the process of modifying the system bootloader, it is crucial to have a basic understanding of what the bootloader is and its purpose. The Red Hat Linux distribution uses GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) as its default bootloader. GRUB is responsible for presenting a menu of available operating systems, loading the selected operating system, and controlling the boot process. It is essential to understand GRUB's configuration files, which are located in the `/boot/grub` directory.

## Step 2: Gathering Information
The first step in modifying the system bootloader is to gather information about the system and its current configuration. This information will help us understand the current settings and make informed decisions when making changes. 

To gather this information, we will use the following commands: 

- `uname -r`: This command will display the Linux kernel version currently in use. 
- `ls /boot`: This command will list all the files and subdirectories in the `/boot` directory. We are interested in the `grub` directory and the `menu.lst` file.
- `cat /boot/grub/grub.conf`: This command will display the current GRUB configuration.

## Step 3: Making Changes to the Bootloader Configuration
Now that we have gathered all the necessary information, we can make changes to the bootloader configuration. Keep in mind that any changes made to the configuration will affect the system's boot process.

### Option 1: Changing the Default Boot Entry
By default, GRUB will boot into the first operating system listed in the `menu.lst` file. If you want to change the default boot entry, follow these steps: 

1. Open the `/boot/grub/menu.lst` file using a text editor. 
2. Find the line that starts with `default` and change its value to reflect the desired boot entry. 
3. Save the changes and exit the text editor. 

### Option 2: Adding a New Boot Entry
If you want to add a new boot entry to the GRUB menu for a different Linux kernel or a different operating system, follow these steps: 

1. Open the `/boot/grub/menu.lst` file using a text editor. 
2. Start by finding the section titled `title`. This section contains the current boot entries.
3. Copy one of the existing boot entries and paste it at the bottom of the section.
4. Give the new boot entry a title, for example, "New Kernel" or "Windows 10."
5. Modify the `root` line to point to the correct location of the operating system.
6. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

### Option 3: Modifying GRUB's Timeout
GRUB has a default timeout of 5 seconds, meaning it will automatically boot into the default entry after 5 seconds. If you want to modify this timeout duration, follow these steps: 

1. Open the `/boot/grub/menu.lst` file using a text editor. 
2. Find the line that starts with `timeout` and change its value to the desired timeout duration.
3. Save the changes and exit the text editor.

## Step 4: Updating GRUB Configuration
After making any changes to the GRUB configuration, you need to update the bootloader's configuration to reflect the changes. To update GRUB's configuration, use the following command: 

`grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

This command will generate a new GRUB configuration file based on the changes made in the `menu.lst` file.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the steps to modify the system bootloader, with a focus on the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective. It is essential to remember that any changes made to the bootloader configuration can impact the system's boot process and should be made with caution. It is also recommended to test the changes on a non-production system before implementing them on a critical system.
