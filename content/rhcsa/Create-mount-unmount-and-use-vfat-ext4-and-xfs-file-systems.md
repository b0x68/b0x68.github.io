# Tutorial: Creating, Mounting, and Unmounting File Systems in Linux

## Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on creating, mounting, and unmounting file systems in Linux. This tutorial will focus specifically on the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective: "Create, mount, unmount, and use vfat, ext4, and xfs file systems". By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the processes involved in creating, mounting, and unmounting file systems in Linux, and be fully prepared to tackle this objective on the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of the Linux operating system and its command line interface. This tutorial will be using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system, but the concepts and commands will be applicable to other Linux distributions as well.

## Understanding File Systems
Before we dive into the details of creating, mounting, and unmounting file systems, it is important to have a basic understanding of what a file system is and why it is necessary. A file system is a way for an operating system to organize and store data on a storage device, such as a hard drive or USB drive. It determines how files are named, stored, and accessed on the storage device. Without a file system, an operating system would not be able to understand and manage the data stored on a storage device.

## Creating File Systems
To create a file system, we will be using the `mkfs` command, which stands for "make file system". This command takes in various options and arguments to create a specific type of file system. For example, to create a vfat file system, we would use the command `mkfs.vfat <device>`, where `<device>` is the name of the storage device we want to create the file system on. Similarly, to create an ext4 file system, we would use the command `mkfs.ext4 <device>`, and for an xfs file system, we would use `mkfs.xfs <device>`.

## Mounting File Systems
Once we have created a file system on a storage device, we need to mount it to a specific location in the file system hierarchy in order to access it. To do this, we will be using the `mount` command. The syntax for this command is `mount <device> <mount point>`, where `<device>` is the name of the storage device with the file system we want to mount, and `<mount point>` is the directory where we want to mount the file system. For example, if we want to mount the vfat file system we created earlier to the `/mnt` directory, we would use the command `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`, assuming that `sda1` is the name of the storage device containing the vfat file system. 

## Understanding Mount Points
A mount point is a directory in the file system hierarchy which serves as the access point for a mounted file system. When a file system is mounted to a specific mount point, all files and directories within that mount point will be redirected to the corresponding file system. It is important to choose a proper mount point to ensure that the file system is easily accessible and organized. In the previous example, we used the `/mnt` directory as our mount point. This is a common choice, but any empty directory on the file system could be used as a mount point.

## Automatically Mounting File Systems
By default, any file system that is mounted will be unmounted when the system is rebooted. To ensure that a file system is automatically mounted on boot, we can add an entry for it in the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains a list of file systems and their corresponding mount points. The syntax for adding an entry is `<device> <mount point> <file system type> <options> <dump> <pass>`. For example, to automatically mount the vfat file system we created earlier to the `/mnt` directory, we would add the following entry to the `/etc/fstab` file:

```
/dev/sda1 /mnt vfat defaults 0 0
```

## Unmounting File Systems
When we are finished using a file system, it is important to properly unmount it before removing the storage device or shutting down the system. To unmount a file system, we use the `umount` command, followed by the mount point of the file system. For example, to unmount the vfat file system we mounted earlier to the `/mnt` directory, we would use the command `umount /mnt`.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the process of creating, mounting, and unmounting file systems in Linux. We have learned how to use the `mkfs` command to create different types of file systems and the `mount` command to mount them to specific mount points. We also discussed the importance of choosing a proper mount point and how to automatically mount file systems on boot. Lastly, we learned how to properly unmount a file system when we are finished using it. We hope this tutorial has helped you understand this Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective in great depth and has prepared you for success on the exam.
