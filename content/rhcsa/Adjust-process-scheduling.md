# Tutorial: Adjusting Process Scheduling in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam

In this tutorial, we will discuss the objective of adjusting process scheduling in the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200 and provide detailed steps and explanations on how to successfully accomplish this task.

## Introduction

In a Linux operating system, the process scheduler is responsible for determining the order in which processes will run on the systemâ€™s CPU. By adjusting the process scheduling, we can optimize the performance of our system and manage the allocation of system resources.

In the RHCSA Exam 200, one of the objectives is to adjust process scheduling. This means that you will be tested on your ability to modify the process scheduler and manage processes on a system. This tutorial will guide you through the necessary steps to successfully complete this objective in the exam.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of Linux and the command line interface
- An RHCSA certification exam environment
- Administrative privileges on the system

## Step 1: Understanding the Process Scheduler in Linux

The Linux process scheduler is responsible for managing the allocation of system resources to processes, such as CPU time, memory, and I/O (input/output) operations. The default process scheduler in most Linux distributions is the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), which uses a priority-based algorithm to determine the order of process execution.

There are several tools and commands that can be used to view and manage the process scheduler, such as `top`, `ps`, and `nice`. Familiarize yourself with these tools before proceeding to the next step.

## Step 2: Modifying Process Scheduling with `nice`

The `nice` command allows you to adjust the priority of a process, which affects its position in the process queue and determines how much system resources it will receive. A higher priority value means the process will receive more resources, while a lower value means the process will have lower priority.

To modify the priority of a process, use the `nice` command followed by the process ID (PID) and the priority value you want to set. For example, to set the priority of the process with PID 1234 to -10 (highest priority), use the command:

`nice -n -10 1234`

You can also use the `renice` command to modify the priority of a process that is already running. This can be useful in situations where a certain process needs more resources to complete its task.

## Step 3: Setting Process Priorities with `chrt`

The `chrt` command can be used to modify the scheduling policy and priority of a process. The scheduling policy determines the behavior and priority of a process, such as real-time or batch. The priority values range from 1 to 99, with 1 being the highest priority.

To use the `chrt` command, you must specify both the scheduling policy and the priority. For example, to set the scheduling policy of a process with PID 1234 to real-time with a priority of 80, use the command:

`chrt -r -p 80 1234`

## Step 4: Viewing and Managing Processes with `top`

The `top` command is a powerful tool for viewing and managing processes in a Linux system. It displays a list of currently running processes, their statuses, and resource usage.

To launch `top`, simply type `top` in the command line. You can use the arrow keys to navigate through the list of processes and the function keys to perform different actions, such as changing the sorting criteria or killing a process.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the objective of adjusting process scheduling in the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. We discussed the importance of the process scheduler in the Linux operating system and provided step-by-step instructions for modifying process priorities using commands such as `nice`, `renice`, and `chrt`.

Remember to practice using these commands and tools in your RHCSA exam environment to prepare yourself thoroughly for the exam. With this knowledge, you should be able to successfully complete the objective of adjusting process scheduling in the RHCSA Exam 200.
