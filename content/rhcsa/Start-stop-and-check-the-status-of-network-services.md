# How to Start, Stop, and Check the Status of Network Services

The Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam (EX200) requires candidates to demonstrate their understanding of managing and troubleshooting network services on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system. As part of this objective, you will need to know how to start, stop, and check the status of network services on your RHEL system. In this tutorial, we will cover the steps you need to follow to successfully complete this task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of the RHEL operating system and how to use the command line interface (CLI). You should also have an RHEL system set up with root access.

## Starting a Network Service

To start a network service on your RHEL system, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the name of the network service you want to start by using the `systemctl` command. This command provides a list of all the services on your system with their current status.
2. Once you have identified the service you want to start, use the `systemctl start [service name]` command to start it. You will need to replace "[service name]" with the actual name of the network service you want to start.
3. Use the `systemctl status [service name]` command to verify that the service has started successfully. This command will show you the current status and any error messages related to the service.

## Stopping a Network Service

To stop a network service on your RHEL system, follow these steps:

1. Identify the name of the network service you want to stop by using the `systemctl` command.
2. Use the `systemctl stop [service name]` command to stop the service. Again, replace "[service name]" with the actual name of the service you want to stop.
3. Use the `systemctl status [service name]` command to verify that the service has stopped. The status should show as "inactive" once the service has been successfully stopped.

## Checking the Status of a Network Service

To check the status of a network service on your RHEL system, you can use the `systemctl status [service name]` command. This command will provide information about the service, including its current state, any recent log messages, and any failure or error messages. Using this command can help you troubleshoot and diagnose any issues with your network services.

You can also use the `systemctl is-active [service name]` command to check if a specific service is currently active. This command will return a "yes" or "no" response, depending on the service's status.

## Additional Tips and Tricks

- You can use the `systemctl list-units --type=service` command to see a list of all active and inactive services on your system.
- If you encounter any errors while starting or stopping a network service, you can use the `systemctl --failed` command to see a list of all failed services and their errors.
- Use the `journalctl -u [service name]` command to view the logs for a specific service. This can help you troubleshoot and diagnose any issues with the service.

## Conclusion

Being able to start, stop, and check the status of network services is an essential skill for a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator. We have covered the basic steps you need to follow to successfully complete this task, but it is always recommended to practice and explore these commands on your own RHEL system. With this knowledge, you should feel confident in managing network services and troubleshooting any issues that may arise. Best of luck on your Red Hat certification journey!
