# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Start, stop, and check the status of network services

In this tutorial, we will go in-depth on how to start, stop, and check the status of network services on a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) environment. Network services are essential components of a computer network that enable communication between devices and systems. As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, it is important to have a thorough understanding of how to manage network services for effective network administration.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of networking concepts and have a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator environment set up.

## Starting Network Services

To start a network service, you will need to use the `systemctl` command. This command is used to control and manage system services on Red Hat-based distributions.

1. Open the command line interface and log in as the `root` user. 
2. To start a specific network service, use the `systemctl start` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to start the Network Time Protocol (NTP) service, use the following command: `systemctl start ntpd`
3. You can also start multiple services at once by listing their names after the `systemctl start` command, separated by a space. For example, to start both the NTP and the Domain Name System (DNS) services, use the following command: `systemctl start ntpd named`
4. To confirm that the service has started successfully, use the `systemctl status` command followed by the name of the service. This command will display the current status of the service, including any error messages if the service failed to start. 

## Stopping Network Services

Stopping a network service is similar to starting one, but instead, you will use the `systemctl stop` command.

1. To stop a specific network service, use the `systemctl stop` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to stop the NTP service, use the following command: `systemctl stop ntpd`
2. You can also stop multiple services at once by listing their names after the `systemctl stop` command, separated by a space. For example, to stop both the NTP and DNS services, use the following command: `systemctl stop ntpd named`
3. To confirm that the service has stopped successfully, use the `systemctl status` command followed by the name of the service. This will display the current status of the service, and it should show that the service is inactive.

## Checking the Status of Network Services

As mentioned earlier, the `systemctl status` command is used to check the status of network services. However, there are other methods that you can use to monitor network services.

1. The `netstat` command is a useful tool for monitoring network services. It displays active network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics.
2. Another helpful command is `ss`, which is a more modern version of `netstat`. It displays more detailed information about active socket connections.
3. You can also check the status of network services by using the `ps` command. This command displays a list of active processes, including network services.
4. The `journalctl` command can be used to view log messages related to network services. This can be helpful in troubleshooting any issues with the service.

## Managing Network Services on Boot

To ensure that network services start automatically on boot, you can use the `enable` command with the `systemctl` command.

1. To enable a specific network service to start on boot, use the `systemctl enable` command followed by the name of the service. For example, to enable the NTP service, use the following command: `systemctl enable ntpd`
2. You can also enable multiple services by listing their names after the `systemctl enable` command, separated by a space.
3. To disable a service from starting on boot, use the `disable` command instead.
4. To test if the service is set to start on boot, you can reboot the system and use the `systemctl status` command to check the service's status.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have gone through the process of starting, stopping, and checking the status of network services on a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator environment. It is essential to have a good understanding of managing network services to ensure a stable and secure network. We have also learned about different commands and tools that can be used to monitor and manage network services effectively. Keep practicing and exploring these concepts to improve your skills as a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator.
