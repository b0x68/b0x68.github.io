# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Diagnose and Address Routine SELinux Policy Violations

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security framework implemented in the Linux kernel, designed to provide enhanced access control mechanisms. It works by enforcing mandatory access controls (MAC) on all processes and files on the system, providing an additional layer of security on top of traditional Linux permissions.

As a system administrator, it is important to be able to diagnose and address any routine SELinux policy violations that may occur on the system. In this tutorial, we will cover the steps involved in understanding and resolving SELinux policy violations.

## Understanding SELinux Policy Violations

SELinux policy violations occur when a process or file attempts to access a resource in a way that is not permitted by the security policy. These violations are logged in the system logs, which can be found in the /var/log/audit/ directory.

To view the SELinux policy violations, we can use the `grep` command to search for the keyword "AVC" in the audit logs:

```
grep AVC /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

This will display a list of all the SELinux policy violations that have occurred on the system, along with the corresponding error message and the affected resource.

## Identifying the Cause of the Violation

The first step in diagnosing a SELinux policy violation is to identify the cause of the violation. The error message in the audit log will provide valuable information to help us understand what caused the violation.

The most common causes of SELinux policy violations include incorrect file or directory permissions, incorrect SELinux context, and missing or incorrect SELinux policies.

## Troubleshooting and Resolving the Violation

Once we have identified the cause of the violation, we can proceed with troubleshooting and resolving the issue. The following steps can help in resolving different types of SELinux policy violations:

### Incorrect File or Directory Permissions

If the SELinux policy violation is caused by incorrect file or directory permissions, we can use the `ls -Z` command to view the SELinux context of the affected resource. We can then use the `chcon` command to change the context to the correct one.

For example, if the audit log shows that the violation occurred on a directory with the context `user_home_t`, but it should have the context `home_dir_t`, we can use the following command to change the context:

```
chcon -R -t home_dir_t /path/to/directory
```

### Incorrect SELinux Context

If the violation is caused by an incorrect SELinux context, we can use the `semanage` command to manage SELinux policies and contexts. We can use the `semanage fcontext` subcommand to add, modify, or delete file contexts.

For example, if the audit log shows that the violation occurred on a file with the context `unlabeled_t`, but it should have the context `httpd_sys_content_t`, we can use the following command to add a new file context for the file:

```
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t "/path/to/file"
```

We can then use the `restorecon` command to apply the new context to the file:

```
restorecon -v /path/to/file
```

### Missing or Incorrect SELinux Policies

Sometimes, a SELinux policy violation can be caused by missing or incorrect SELinux policies. In such cases, we can use the `semanage` command to manage the SELinux policies on the system.

We can use the `semanage fcontext` subcommand to add, modify, or delete policies. For example, if the policy violation occurs when a process tries to access a specific port, we can add a new policy to allow the process to access that port:

```
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp <port_number>
```

We can also use the `setsebool` command to toggle SELinux boolean values that enable or disable certain permissions. For example, if the violation occurs because a process is not allowed to send mail, we can use the following command to enable the `httpd_can_sendmail` boolean value:

```
setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail on
```

### Audit2Allow

In some cases, SELinux policy violations may be caused by a specific process that is not allowed to access certain resources. This may be due to a custom application that is not included in the default SELinux policies.

To diagnose and address such violations, we can use the `audit2allow` command. This command reads the audit log and generates a list of rules that will allow the denied access.

We can then use the generated rules to create a custom module and load it into SELinux using the `semodule` command. This will allow the specific process to access the necessary resources without compromising the overall security of the system.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the steps involved in understanding and resolving routine SELinux policy violations. As a system administrator, it is important to be familiar with these steps to effectively manage SELinux policies and ensure the security of the system. By following these steps, we can easily diagnose and address SELinux policy violations and maintain a secure and stable system.
