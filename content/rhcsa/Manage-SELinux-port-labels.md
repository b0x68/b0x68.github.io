# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Manage SELinux Port Labels

Securing a system against unauthorized access is one of the top priorities for any Linux system administrator. One way to increase the security of a system is by using SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), a security framework for Linux that provides an additional layer of access control.

One aspect of SELinux is its ability to manage port labels, which restrict access to network ports based on their labels. In this tutorial, we will explore everything you need to know about managing SELinux port labels to pass the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective.

## Understanding SELinux Port Labels

SELinux uses port labels to control network access and allow or deny connections to specific ports based on their labels. By default, when SELinux is enabled, all network ports are assigned with a label that restricts access to those ports. This label is referred to as the default port label.

To view the default port labels on your system, you can use the `semanage` command with the `port` option:

`semanage port -l`

You will see a list of ports and their corresponding default labels, assigned by SELinux. These labels are used by SELinux policies to control access to specific ports.

## Managing SELinux Port Labels

To manage SELinux port labels, you will need to use the `semanage` command with the `port` option. This command allows you to add or remove custom port labels and modify existing ones.

### Adding a Custom Port Label

To add a custom port label, you will need to specify the port number and its corresponding label using the `semanage port -a` command. For example, to add a label for port 8080 with the label `http_port_t`, you would use the following command:

`semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8080`

This command adds a new rule to the SELinux policy, allowing TCP connections to port 8080 with the `http_port_t` label.

### Removing a Custom Port Label

To remove a custom port label, you can use the `semanage port -d` command. For example, to remove the `http_port_t` label from port 8080, you would use the following command:

`semanage port -d -p tcp 8080`

This command removes the rule from the SELinux policy, preventing TCP connections to port 8080 with the `http_port_t` label.

### Modifying an Existing Port Label

You can also modify an existing port label using the `semanage port -m` command. This command allows you to change the label assigned to a particular port. For example, to change the label for port 8080 from `http_port_t` to `ftp_port_t`, you would use the following command:

`semanage port -m -t ftp_port_t -p tcp 8080`

This command modifies the rule in the SELinux policy, allowing TCP connections to port 8080 with the new `ftp_port_t` label.

## Troubleshooting SELinux Port Labels

In case you encounter issues with SELinux port labels, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve them.

### Check SELinux Audit Logs

The first step would be to check SELinux audit logs using the `aureport` command. These logs provide information about SELinux denials and can help identify the source of the issue.

### Reset to Default Labels

If you are unsure which custom labels are causing the issue, you can reset all ports to their default labels using the `restorecon` command. This will reset all port labels and their corresponding file labels to their default settings.

### Use the SELinux Troubleshooter Tool

SELinux also provides a troubleshooter tool, `setroubleshoot`, that can help diagnose and troubleshoot issues with SELinux. This tool analyzes audit logs and offers suggestions for fixing the issue.

## Disabling SELinux Port Labels

If you need to temporarily disable SELinux port labels, you can use the `setenforce` command. This command allows you to switch SELinux into either enforcing or permissive mode.

Enforcing mode will enforce SELinux policies, including port labels, while permissive mode will log any violations but not enforce them.

To switch SELinux to permissive mode, use the following command:

`setenforce 0`

You can switch back to enforcing mode by using the command `setenforce 1`.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered everything you need to know about managing SELinux port labels for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective. We learned what SELinux port labels are, how to add, remove, and modify custom port labels, and how to troubleshoot issues with SELinux port labels.

Remember, SELinux provides an additional layer of security for your system, and understanding how to manage port labels is essential for passing the exam and securing your system against unauthorized access.
