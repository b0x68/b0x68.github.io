# Tutorial: Managing Tuning Profiles for Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200

## Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on managing tuning profiles for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. In this tutorial, we will deep dive into the concept of tuning profiles, their use cases, and how to manage them effectively. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a thorough understanding of tuning profiles and be well-prepared to answer related questions in the exam.

## What are Tuning Profiles?
Tuning profiles are preconfigured system settings that optimize the performance of specific workloads. These profiles are used to adjust various parameters in the system, such as CPU, memory, and disk usage, to improve performance and resource utilization. These profiles are especially useful for servers and production environments where maximum performance is required.

## Use Cases for Tuning Profiles
Tuning profiles are helpful in various scenarios, including:

- Improving application performance: Tuning profiles can be used to optimize system resources for specific applications, allowing them to run more efficiently.
- Reducing resource usage: By adjusting system parameters, tuning profiles can help to reduce resource consumption and improve overall system efficiency.
- Troubleshooting performance issues: Tuning profiles can be used to diagnose and resolve performance issues by adjusting specific parameters to improve system performance.

## Types of Tuning Profiles
There are three main types of tuning profiles that are commonly used:

### Performance
The Performance profile is designed to provide maximum performance for CPU-intensive workloads. It increases the clock speed of the CPU and can be used for applications that require high computing power, such as databases and virtualization.

### Balanced
The Balanced profile provides a balance between performance and energy efficiency. It is suitable for a wide range of workloads and is the default profile in most systems.

### Power Save
The Power Save profile is designed to reduce power consumption and extend battery life on laptops or other portable devices. It adjusts system parameters to minimize resource usage and is most suitable for low-demand workloads.

## Managing Tuning Profiles
Now, let's dive into how to manage tuning profiles in Red Hat systems.

### Checking Current Profile
To check the current tuning profile, use the `tuned-adm active` command. It will display the active profile name, as well as the list of available profiles.

### Switching Profiles
To switch to a different profile, use the `tuned-adm profile <profile_name>` command. For example, to switch to the Balanced profile, we would use `tuned-adm profile balanced`.

### Creating Custom Profiles
You can also create your own custom tuning profiles to meet specific application requirements. To do so, use the `tuned-adm create <profile_name>` command. This will create a new profile with default settings. You can then use the `tuned-adm edit <profile_name>` command to modify the profile's settings and parameters.

### Setting Default Profiles
You can set a default profile for the system using the `tuned-adm default <profile_name>` command. This will make the specified profile the default one, so it automatically applies when the system boots.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have covered the concept of tuning profiles and their use cases. We have also discussed the different types of tuning profiles and how to manage them in Red Hat systems. By understanding the intricacies of tuning profiles, you will be able to optimize system performance and troubleshoot performance issues effectively. We hope this tutorial has helped in preparing you for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective on managing tuning profiles. Good luck!
