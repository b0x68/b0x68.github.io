# How to Configure Network Services to Start Automatically at Boot

In this tutorial, we will discuss how to configure network services to start automatically at boot for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective. This is an important skill for administrators as it ensures that network services are always running, providing continuity to operations and preventing potential issues.

## Prerequisites
- A Red Hat Enterprise Linux system
- Basic knowledge of system administration and networking concepts

## Step 1: Understanding Network Services
Network services are applications or processes that run in the background and provide network functionality to a system. These can include services such as DHCP, DNS, FTP, SSH, and more. These services are essential for a system to communicate with other devices on the network.

## Step 2: Identifying Network Services to Start at Boot
The first step in configuring network services to start automatically at boot is to identify which services need to be started. To do this, you can check the list of currently running services using the `systemctl list-unit-files` command. This will display all the services that are currently enabled and disabled on your system.

## Step 3: Enabling Network Services
To start a network service at boot, you need to enable it using the `systemctl enable <service>` command. For example, to enable the SSH service, the command would be `systemctl enable sshd.service`. This command will create a symbolic link in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory, ensuring that the service starts at boot.

## Step 4: Disabling Network Services
If you want to disable a network service from starting at boot, you can use the `systemctl disable <service>` command. This will remove the corresponding symbolic link from the `/etc/systemd/system` directory, preventing the service from starting at boot.

## Step 5: Verifying Service Status
After enabling or disabling a network service, it's essential to verify its status to ensure that the changes have been applied correctly. You can use the `systemctl status <service>` command to check the status of a specific service. If the service is enabled, the output of this command will show as 'active.'

## Step 6: Setting Service Priority
In some instances, it may be necessary to adjust the priority of a network service. The default service priority is determined by the order defined in the `Before` and `After` properties in the service unit configuration file. However, you can use the `systemctl set-property <service>` command to modify the start or stop priorities of a service. For example, to set the priority of the SSH service to 'high,' the command would be `systemctl set-property sshd.service StartupPriority=high`.

## Step 7: Using Service Templates
If you have multiple services that need to start at boot, you can use service templates to save time and effort. These templates are predefined sets of services that can be enabled or disabled at once using the `systemctl enable <template>.target` and `systemctl disable <template>.target` commands. For example, to enable the 'basic.target' template, which includes essential network services, the command would be `systemctl enable basic.target`.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, configuring network services to start automatically at boot is a critical task for system administrators. It ensures that necessary network services are always running and can be accessed by other devices on the network. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you should be able to successfully configure network services to start at boot for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective.
