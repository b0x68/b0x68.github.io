# How to Configure Network Services to Start Automatically at Boot

In this tutorial, we will explore the objective of the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200: configuring network services to start automatically at boot. This is a crucial task for any system administrator, as it ensures that network services are always available and running upon system startup. This tutorial will cover the steps required to configure network services to start automatically at boot in great depth.

## Step 1: Understanding Network Services
Before we dive into the steps for configuring network services, it is important to have a clear understanding of what network services are. Network services are programs or processes that run on a system and provide network-related functions such as serving web pages, email, or file sharing. These services are essential for communication and data transfer between devices on a network.

## Step 2: Identifying Network Services to be Configured
The first step in configuring network services to start automatically at boot is to identify which services need to be configured. This will depend on the specific requirements of your system and network. Some commonly used network services include Apache, OpenSSH, and DHCP. It is important to have a list of all required services before proceeding with the configuration process.

## Step 3: Using Systemd to Configure Network Services
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the preferred method for managing services is through the Systemd service manager. Systemd is responsible for starting, stopping, and managing system services. To configure network services to start automatically at boot, we will use the `systemctl` command.

## Step 4: Enabling and Disabling Services
The `systemctl` command has various options for managing services, including enabling and disabling them. To enable a service, use the command:
```
sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
```
This will create a symlink to the service unit file in the appropriate Systemd target, ensuring that the service starts automatically at boot. To disable a service from starting at boot, use the command:
```
sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
```
This will remove the symlink and prevent the service from starting at boot.

## Step 5: Checking Service Status
To check the status of a service, use the command:
```
systemctl status <service_name>
```
This will display information about the service, including whether it is currently running and if it is configured to start at boot.

## Step 6: Configuring Dependencies
Network services often have dependencies on other services. These dependencies need to be managed carefully to ensure that all required services start in the correct order at boot. Systemd allows for the configuration of dependencies using the `Requires=` and `After=` directives in a service unit file.

## Step 7: Editing Service Unit Files
Service unit files contain configuration settings for individual services. These files can be edited using a text editor, such as `vi` or `nano`. To edit a service unit file, use the command:
```
sudo systemctl edit <service_name>
```
This will open the file in a text editor, allowing you to make any necessary changes.

## Step 8: Saving and Reloading Changes
After making changes to a service unit file, it is important to save the changes and reload the Systemd daemon for them to take effect. To save changes, use the command `:wq` in `vi` or `Ctrl + X` followed by `y` in `nano`. To reload the daemon, use the command:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
```
This will ensure that any changes made to service configurations are applied.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have explored the objective of configuring network services to start automatically at boot in great depth. We have covered the definition of network services, how to identify and manage them using Systemd, and how to configure dependencies and make changes to service unit files. This is a crucial task in maintaining a stable and efficient system, and with the steps outlined in this tutorial, you will be able to successfully configure network services to start automatically at boot.
