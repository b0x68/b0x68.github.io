## Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on how to restore default file contexts in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. In this tutorial, we will go through the process of restoring default file contexts step by step. We will also discuss what file contexts are, why they are important, and how to manage them effectively.

## What are File Contexts?
File contexts are a crucial aspect of security in Red Hat Linux operating systems. File contexts are labels that are attached to files and directories to determine their intended purpose and restrict access based on that purpose. They are an essential part of SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux), which is a security feature used in Red Hat Linux systems.

## Why are File Contexts Important?
File contexts play a significant role in maintaining the security of a system. They help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories. By labeling files and directories with specific contexts, SELinux can enforce restrictions on their access, preventing them from being accessed or modified by unauthorized users. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain and manage file contexts effectively to ensure the security of the system.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Restore Default File Contexts
Now let's go through the process of restoring default file contexts step by step.

### Step 1: Identify File Contexts
The first step is to identify the file contexts that need to be restored. This can be done by using the `ls -Z` command, which will list the file contexts of all files and directories in the current directory.

### Step 2: Locate the File Context Database
The file contexts are stored in the SELinux file context database, which is usually located at `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts`.

### Step 3: Backup the File Context Database
Before making any changes to the file context database, it is essential to create a backup in case something goes wrong. This can be done with the following command:

`# cp -a /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.bak`

### Step 4: Edit the File Context Database
To restore default file contexts, we will need to edit the file context database. Open the file using your preferred text editor, and make the necessary changes. You can also use the `restorecon` command to restore just a specific file or directory. For example, `restorecon -v /etc/passwd` will restore the default file context for the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Step 5: Apply Changes
Once the changes have been made to the file context database, we need to apply them to the system. This can be done using the `restorecon` command with the `-R` flag to recursively restore the file contexts for all files and directories.

### Step 6: Verify Changes
To ensure that the changes have been applied successfully, you can use the `ls -Z` command again to check the file contexts of the files and directories. They should now match the default file contexts specified in the file context database.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, restoring default file contexts is an important task in maintaining the security of a Red Hat Linux system. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively restore default file contexts and ensure the protection of sensitive files and directories. It is also essential to regularly check and manage file contexts to keep your system secure.
