# Tutorial: How to Restore Default File Contexts in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam

In this tutorial, we will learn how to restore default file contexts in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective. File contexts refer to the security labels that are assigned to files and directories on a Red Hat Linux system. These labels are used to enforce security policies and control access to system resources. In some situations, files may have their contexts changed or corrupted. It is important for a certified systems administrator to know how to restore these file contexts to their default settings. 

## Step 1: Understanding Default File Contexts

Before we begin, let's first understand what default file contexts are. By default, each file and directory on a Red Hat Linux system has a set of attributes and permissions that dictate how it can be accessed and used. These attributes are known as file contexts. The default file contexts are defined in the `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/filesystem_contexts` file. This file contains a list of files and the contexts that should be applied to them. These contexts are automatically applied when files are created, modified, or relocated. If something happens to change these contexts, it is important to restore them to their default settings. 

## Step 2: Checking File Contexts

Before attempting to restore default file contexts, it is important to first check the current contexts of the files and directories in question. To do this, we can use the `ls -Z` command. This will show the current file contexts in the output. This step will help us identify which files and directories have modified contexts and need to be restored. 

## Step 3: Restore File Contexts Using `restorecon`

The easiest way to restore file contexts to their default settings is by using the `restorecon` command. This command is specifically designed to reset file contexts to their original defaults. To use `restorecon`, we can use the following syntax:

```
restorecon [-irv] <file or directory>
```

The various options for this command are:

- `-i`: Prompts for confirmation before changing the context of each file or directory.
- `-r`: Applies the same context to all files and subdirectories within a given directory.
- `-v`: Verbose output, shows the changes being made.

In most cases, we can run `restorecon` without any options and it will automatically reset the file contexts to their defaults. However, using the `-v` option can be helpful for viewing the changes being made. And if you want to be extra cautious, you can use the `-i` option to confirm each change before it is made. 

## Step 4: Restoring Multiple Files and Directories

In some cases, files and directories may have their contexts modified or corrupted in bulk. This can happen after a system crash or when transferring data from one system to another. There are a few different methods we can use to restore contexts for multiple files and directories at once, depending on the situation.

### Method 1: Using Wildcards

If the files or directories to be restored are located in the same directory, we can use wildcards to apply the same context to multiple files or directories at once. For example, if we want to restore the contexts of all files with the `.conf` extension in the `/etc` directory, we can use the following command:

```
restorecon -v /etc/*.conf
```

This will reset the contexts of all `.conf` files in the `/etc` directory to their defaults.

### Method 2: Using `find` and `restorecon`

If the files or directories to be restored are located in different directories, we can use the `find` and `restorecon` commands together to restore their contexts. For example, if we want to restore the contexts of all files and directories named `data` in the `/opt` and `/var` directories, we can use the following command:

```
find /{opt,var} -name data -exec restorecon {} \;
```

This will run the `restorecon` command on all files and directories named `data` in the specified directories.

## Step 5: Verify the Changes

Once we have restored the file contexts, it is important to verify that the changes have been applied successfully. We can do this by once again using the `ls -Z` command to check the current contexts of the files and directories. If the file contexts have been successfully restored, they should now match the default contexts from the `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/filesystem_contexts` file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to restore default file contexts in Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam Objective 200. We have seen the importance of understanding default file contexts and how to check and restore them using the `restorecon` command. We have also explored different methods for restoring contexts for multiple files and directories at once. It is essential for a certified systems administrator to have a thorough understanding of file contexts and how to restore them to their default settings in order to maintain the security and integrity of a Red Hat Linux system.
