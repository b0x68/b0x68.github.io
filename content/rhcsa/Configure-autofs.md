# Tutorial: Configuring autofs on Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam

## Introduction

Autofs is a service provided by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) that automatically mounts file systems based on user or program request. It is used to manage file systems that are accessed infrequently, reducing the server's load and conserving resources. This tutorial will provide a comprehensive guide to configuring autofs for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the tutorial, it is assumed that you have a basic understanding of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and are familiar with the command line interface.

## Step 1: Installing autofs

The first step is to ensure that the autofs package is installed on your system. To do this, open a terminal and run the command: 

```
sudo yum install autofs
```

This will install the autofs package along with any necessary dependencies.

## Step 2: Configuring autofs

Now that autofs is installed, we can begin configuring it. The configuration file for autofs is located at `/etc/auto.master`. Open this file in a text editor of your choice. 

The first line in this file should be commented out with a `#` symbol. We will leave this as is and add our own configuration below it.

## Step 3: Adding Entries to auto.master

Each entry in the `/etc/auto.master` file follows the format of `mount-point map-name [map-options]`. Autofs will mount file systems at the specified mount point when it is accessed by the user or program.

Let's say we want to configure autofs to mount the `/home` directory on our remote NFS server at the `/mnt/nfs` directory on our local machine. Add the following line to the bottom of the `auto.master` file:

```
/mnt/nfs /etc/auto.nfs --timeout=600
```

Here, we have specified the mount point as `/mnt/nfs`, the map name as `auto.nfs`, and the timeout (in seconds) as 600. The map name can be any name you choose, but it is recommended to use the `.nfs` file extension for NFS mounts.

## Step 4: Creating the Map File

Now, we will create the map file specified in the `auto.master` configuration. In this case, we will create a file named `auto.nfs` in the `/etc` directory. This can be done using the command:

```
sudo touch /etc/auto.nfs
```

Next, we need to add the NFS server and the exported directory to the map file. The syntax for NFS maps is `server:/path options`. In our case, we will add the following line to the `auto.nfs` file:

```
nfs-server:/home -fstype=nfs,rw,nosuid,nodev,proto=tcp,nfsvers=3 0 0
```

This will mount the `/home` directory from the NFS server with read/write permissions, and the specified NFS mount options.

## Step 5: Restarting the autofs Service

To apply the changes we have made, we need to restart the autofs service. This can be done using the command:

```
sudo systemctl restart autofs
```

## Step 6: Testing the Configuration

To test if the configuration is working, we can try accessing the `/mnt/nfs` directory by running the `ls` command. If everything is configured correctly, you should see the contents of the remote `/home` directory listed.

## Additional Tips

- When creating map files for autofs, it is important to ensure that the file has the correct permissions (`644` recommended) and is owned by the root user.
- To avoid any potential issues, it is recommended to use absolute paths in the `auto.master` and map files.
- Autofs logs can be found in the `/var/log/messages` file, which can be useful for troubleshooting any errors or issues.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to configure autofs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam. You now know how to install autofs, add entries to the `auto.master` file, create map files, and test the configuration. With this knowledge, you will be able to efficiently manage file systems on your RHEL system using autofs.
