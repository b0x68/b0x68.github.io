# Inspect Container Images

In this tutorial, we will dive in-depth into the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: "Inspect container images". Container images are an essential component of containerized applications and understanding how to inspect and manage them is a crucial skill for any systems administrator. In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of container images, the tools used for inspection, and the different components of an image that can be inspected.

## What are Container Images?

Container images are self-contained, standalone packages that contain all the necessary files and dependencies to run an application. They are used to create containers, which are isolated and portable environments for running applications. These images are typically lightweight and can be easily distributed, making them a popular choice for deploying applications.

## Tools for Inspecting Container Images

There are various tools that can be used to inspect container images, but in this tutorial, we will focus on the three most commonly used ones - Docker, Podman, and Buildah.

**Docker** is a popular open-source container platform that allows developers to build, run, and share containerized applications. It includes a utility called `docker inspect` that can be used to view detailed information about a container image such as its layers, environment variables, exposed ports, and more.

**Podman** is a recently developed tool that is gaining popularity due to its security features and ability to run containers without requiring root privileges. Podman includes the `podman inspect` command, which can also be used to inspect container images. Similarly to `docker inspect`, it provides detailed information about the image, including its layers, labels, environment variables, and more.

**Buildah** is another open-source tool that is used for building, inspecting, and managing container images. It has a command called `buildah inspect` that can be used to inspect an image's structure, history, and configuration.

## Components of a Container Image

Before we dive into inspecting container images, it's essential to understand the different components that make up an image.

**Layers** are the building blocks of a container image. Each layer contains a specific set of files or changes to the image.

**Metadata** is information about the image such as its name, version, labels, and environment variables.

**Configuration** refers to the instructions that are used to build the image. This includes the base image used, the commands used to install dependencies, and any other configuration settings.

## Inspecting Container Images

Now that we have an understanding of the tools and components involved let's go through the steps to inspect a container image using the `docker inspect`, `podman inspect`, and `buildah inspect` commands.

### 1. Choose an Image to Inspect

The first step is to select an image to inspect. For this tutorial, we will use the **nginx** image from Docker Hub, a popular web server and reverse proxy.

### 2. Docker Inspect

To inspect the nginx image using Docker, run the following command:

```
docker inspect nginx
```

This will display detailed information about the image, including its ID, layers, history, and more. The output will be in JSON format, so it might be helpful to pipe the output to a tool like **jq** to filter out specific information.

### 3. Podman Inspect

To inspect the same nginx image using Podman, run the following command:

```
podman inspect nginx
```

This will provide similar information as the `docker inspect` command, but the output will be in a more human-readable format.

### 4. Buildah Inspect

Finally, to inspect the nginx image using Buildah, run the following command:

```
buildah inspect nginx
```

This will display information about the image's configuration, including the base image used, entrypoint, and environment variables. Similar to `docker inspect`, the output will be in JSON format.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully gone through all the steps to inspect a container image using the `docker inspect`, `podman inspect`, and `buildah inspect` commands. You now have a better understanding of the tools and components involved in inspecting container images, which will help you prepare for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: "Inspect container images". Keep practicing and exploring different tools to become an expert in container management. Good luck!
