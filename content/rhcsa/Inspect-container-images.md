# Tutorial:Inspecting Container Images for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam

## Introduction
In the world of DevOps, containerization has become a crucial aspect of software development. It allows for the creation, packaging, and deployment of applications in a consistent and efficient way. As a Red Hat Certified System Administrator, it is important to have a deep understanding of container images and how to properly inspect them. In this tutorial, we will dive into the objective of "Inspecting container images" for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam and discuss the steps and tools needed to successfully complete this task.

## Objectives
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Explain the importance of inspecting container images
- Identify the components of a container image
- Use tools to inspect container images
- Understand how to inspect a container image for security vulnerabilities

## Why Inspect Container Images?
Before we dive into how to inspect container images, let's first understand why it is important. Container images serve as the foundation for containerized applications. Without proper inspection, these images can potentially contain insecure or outdated components, leading to security vulnerabilities. Inspecting container images allows for the identification and remediation of any issues before deployment, ensuring a secure and stable production environment.

## Components of a Container Image
Before we can begin inspecting a container image, it is essential to understand the various components that make up an image. These components are what give an image its functionality and determine its size. They include:
- Base Image: The starting point for a container image, it is the foundation upon which all other layers are built.
- OS Libraries: These are libraries required to run the application inside the container.
- Application Binaries: The actual application code that will be executed when the container is running.
- Environment Variables: These variables define the runtime environment for the container.
- Dependencies: Any extra packages or libraries needed by the application to function.

## Tools for Inspecting Container Images
Now that we understand the components of a container image let's discuss the tools we can use to inspect them. There are several tools available, but for this tutorial, we will focus on three popular ones: Skopeo, Dive, and Clair.

### Skopeo
Skopeo is a command-line tool that allows for the inspection and sharing of container images across different container registries. This tool can be used to query the contents of a container image, verify its integrity, and even copy images between registries.

To use Skopeo, first install it on your system using the appropriate package manager. Once installed, you can use the following command to inspect an image:
```
skopeo inspect docker://<image-name>
```

This will provide a detailed output of the image, including its size, layers, and build history.

### Dive
Dive is another command-line tool that allows for a more in-depth inspection of container images. It provides a visual representation of the layers that make up an image, along with a breakdown of their contents and sizes.

To use Dive, first install it on your system using the appropriate package manager. Once installed, you can use the following command to inspect an image:
```
dive <image-name>
```

This will open a terminal-based UI, displaying a tree-like structure of the image's layers, which you can navigate and explore.

### Clair
As we mentioned earlier, security is a critical aspect of inspecting container images. This is where Clair comes in. It is an open-source security scanning tool specifically designed for container images. It analyzes container images for known security vulnerabilities and reports on any issues found.

To use Clair, you will first need to install and setup a Clair server. Once set up, you can use the `clairctl` command-line tool to scan a container image, like so:
```
clairctl analyze <image-name>
```

This will generate a report detailing any security vulnerabilities found in the image, along with their severity level and a link to the CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database.

## Inspecting Images for Security Vulnerabilities
Now that we have gone through the tools, let's put them into practice and learn how to inspect a container image for security vulnerabilities.

### Step 1: Choose an Image to Inspect
The first step is to select an image that you would like to inspect. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will use the popular "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.

### Step 2: Use Skopeo to Inspect the Image
Using the Skopeo command, inspect the image and take note of its name, size, and layers. In this case, the output should look like this:
```
skopeo inspect docker://hello-world
```
```

            "StartPeriod": 0
        }
    },
    "History": null
}
```

### Step 3: Use Dive to Inspect the Image
Next, use the Dive command to inspect the image further. You will be presented with a UI that allows you to navigate through the layers and view their contents.

### Step 4: Use Clair to Scan for Vulnerabilities
Finally, use the Clair command to scan the image for security vulnerabilities. In this case, it should come back clean, as the "hello-world" image is a very basic image with no potential vulnerabilities.
