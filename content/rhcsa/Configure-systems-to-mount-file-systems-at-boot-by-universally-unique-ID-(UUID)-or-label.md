# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: 
## Configure Systems to Mount File Systems at Boot by Universally Unique ID (UUID) or Label

File systems are an essential aspect of any operating system, as they allow for the organization and storage of data. In Red Hat Linux, file systems can be mounted at boot by using either the universally unique ID (UUID) or the label of the file system. This feature helps ensure that the correct file system is mounted during the boot process and prevents any issues with incorrect or missing file systems.

To successfully complete this objective, one should be familiar with basic Linux commands and have a thorough understanding of file systems and their management. This tutorial will guide you through the process of configuring systems to mount file systems at boot using both UUID and label in Red Hat Linux.

## Understanding UUID and Label

Before we dive into the configuration process, let's first understand what UUID and label are and their significance in mounting file systems.

**Universally Unique ID (UUID)** is a 128-bit identifier that is assigned to a specific file system during its creation. It is a unique identifier that ensures no two file systems will have the same UUID, even if they are on the same system. During the boot process, UUID is used to identify and mount the correct file system with its respective UUID.

**Label** is an alternative to UUID and is a user-assigned identifier for a file system. Unlike UUID, which is automatically generated, labels can be chosen by the user and assigned to a file system. Labels are useful when managing multiple file systems, as they can help identify them more easily and make the mounting process more convenient.

## Identifying File System UUID and Label

Before we can configure systems to mount file systems at boot using UUID and label, we need to first identify the UUID and label of the file systems we want to use. This can be done using the `blkid` command, which displays information about all the block devices connected to the system, including their UUID, label, and other details.

To use the `blkid` command, open a terminal and type the following:
```
blkid
```
This will display a list of all the block devices and their information. Look for the file system you want to mount at boot and take note of its UUID and label.

## Mounting File Systems at Boot using UUID

To mount a file system at boot using UUID, we need to add an entry for it in the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains information about file systems and their mount points, and is read during the boot process to mount the file systems listed in it.

To add an entry for a file system in the `/etc/fstab` file, we need to know the file system's UUID, mount point, file system type, and mount options (if any).

Open the `/etc/fstab` file using a text editor such as `vi` or `nano` and add a new line at the end for the file system we want to mount using its UUID. The entry should be in the following format:
```
UUID=<file_system_UUID>   <mount_point>  <file_system_type>   <mount_options>   <dump_freq>   <fsck_order>
```
* `<file_system_UUID>` - the UUID of the file system to be mounted
* `<mount_point>` - the directory where the file system will be mounted
* `<file_system_type>` - the type of file system (e.g. ext4, ntfs, etc.)
* `<mount_options>` - any mount options to be applied, such as read-only or noexec 
* `<dump_freq>` - determines whether the file system should be included in the system backup process (usually set to 0)
* `<fsck_order>` - determines the order in which file system checks should be performed during boot (usually set to 1)

Save the changes and exit the text editor. During the next boot, the file system will be mounted at the specified mount point using its UUID.

## Mounting File Systems at Boot using Label

To mount a file system at boot using label, we need to first assign a label to the file system using the `e2label` command. This is specific to ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems.

To assign a label to a file system, open a terminal and type the following command:
```
e2label /dev/<device_name> <label>
```
* `/dev/<device_name>` - the name of the device that contains the file system (e.g. sda1)
* `<label>` - the label you want to assign to the file system 

Once the label is assigned, we can then add an entry for the file system in the `/etc/fstab` file in the same format as we did for the UUID entry, but replacing the UUID with the label.

Save the changes and exit the text editor. During the next boot, the file system will be mounted at the specified mount point using its label.

## Testing the Configuration

Finally, to test our configuration, we can reboot the system and check if the file system was successfully mounted at boot. If the file system is mounted at the specified mount point, then our configuration was successful.

In case of any errors or issues, we can refer back to the `/etc/fstab` file and make necessary changes to fix the problem.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to configure systems to mount file systems at boot using both UUID and label in Red Hat Linux. We also discussed the differences between UUID and label and how they can be used to identify and mount file systems during the boot process.

Mounting file systems at boot by UUID or label helps ensure the correct file systems are mounted and prevents any errors or issues with file systems not being found. This is an important task for any system administrator and a crucial topic to understand for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam.
