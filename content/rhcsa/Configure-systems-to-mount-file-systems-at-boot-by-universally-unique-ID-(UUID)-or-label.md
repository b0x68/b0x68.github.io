#Configuring Systems to Mount File Systems at Boot using UUID or Label

In this tutorial, we will learn how to configure a Red Hat system to mount file systems at boot using either the universally unique identifier (UUID) or label. This is an important objective for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200, as it ensures the system can successfully boot with the correct file systems mounted.

##Introduction to UUID and Label

Before we dive into the steps of configuring systems to mount file systems at boot using UUID or label, let's understand what these two terms mean.

1. UUID - This is a unique identifier assigned to each file system in the Linux operating system. This identifier remains constant even if the file system is moved to a different location or if the device name changes. The UUID is usually composed of 32 hexadecimal digits and is used to uniquely identify and mount file systems.

2. Label - Labels are user-defined names that can be assigned to file systems for easier identification. Unlike UUIDs, labels can be changed without affecting the file system itself. Labels are especially useful when dealing with multiple file systems where device names may change.

Now that we have a basic understanding of UUID and label, let's move on to the steps for configuring systems to mount file systems at boot.

##Step 1: Identify the UUID or Label of the File System

The first step is to identify the UUID or label of the file system you want to mount at boot. To do this, you can use the `blkid` command, which displays the UUID and label of all block devices.

```
$ blkid
```

The output will list all the devices along with their UUIDs and labels. Take note of the UUID or label of the file system you want to mount at boot.

##Step 2: Editing the fstab File

Once you have identified the UUID or label, the next step is to edit the `/etc/fstab` file. This file contains the configuration for mounting file systems at boot.

Using your preferred text editor, open the `/etc/fstab` file.

```
$ sudo vi /etc/fstab
```

##Step 3: Mounting File Systems using UUID

To mount a file system using the UUID, we use the following syntax in the `fstab` file:

```
UUID=<UUID>  <mount point>  <file system type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
```

The fields in this syntax are explained below:

- UUID: The UUID of the file system.
- Mount Point: The directory where the file system will be mounted.
- File System Type: The type of the file system, e.g. ext4, xfs.
- Options: Optional parameters for the file system. These can be used to set read/write permission or other behaviors.
- Dump: This field is not used in Red Hat systems and must be set as 0.
- Pass: This field specifies the order in which `fsck` runs to check the file system. Set this to 0 for non-root file systems.

An example of mounting a file system using the UUID would look like this:

```
UUID=01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef    /mnt/fs1    ext4    defaults    0    0
```

##Step 4: Mounting File Systems using Label

Similar to mounting a file system using UUID, we use the following syntax in the `fstab` file to mount a file system using label:

```
LABEL=<label>  <mount point>  <file system type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
```

The only difference here is that we use the label instead of the UUID. An example of this would look like:

```
LABEL=fs1    /mnt/fs1    ext4    defaults    0    0
```

##Step 5: Saving and Testing the Configuration

After editing the `fstab` file, save the changes and close the file. To test if the file system is mounted correctly at boot, you can either reboot the system or use the `mount -a` command. This command will attempt to mount all file systems listed in the `fstab` file.

```
$ sudo mount -a
```

If there are no errors, the file system will be mounted successfully.

##Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to configure a Red Hat system to mount file systems at boot using either UUID or label. This is a crucial objective for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 and it ensures that the system can boot properly with the necessary file systems mounted. Take note of the steps and practice them on your own to become proficient in configuring systems to mount file systems at boot using UUID or label.
