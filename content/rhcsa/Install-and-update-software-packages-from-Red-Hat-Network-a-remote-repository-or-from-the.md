# Tutorial: Installing and Updating Software Packages from Red Hat Network

### Introduction

In order to become a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, one of the objectives you must demonstrate proficiency in is the ability to install and update software packages from Red Hat Network. This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing and updating software packages from Red Hat Network, a remote repository, or from the command line. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to easily manage software packages on a Red Hat system.

### Prerequisites

Before we begin, it is important to have a basic understanding of the Linux command line and have access to a Red Hat system. Additionally, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:

- Software packages
- Red Hat Network (RHN)
- Remote repositories

### Step 1: Accessing Red Hat Network

The first step to installing and updating software packages is to access Red Hat Network. This can be done through the RHN website or through the command line using the 'rhnsd' daemon. If you are using the GUI interface, simply open a web browser and go to https://rhn.redhat.com. If you are using the command line, start the 'rhnsd' daemon by running the command `service rhnsd start`.

### Step 2: Registering to Red Hat Network

Before you can install or update software packages from RHN, you must register to the network and have an active subscription. To register, use the `subscription-manager` command with appropriate options, such as your account information and subscription pool. Alternatively, you can also use the GUI interface and click on the "Register" button.

### Step 3: Searching for Software Packages

Once you are registered to RHN, you can start searching for software packages that you want to install or update on your system. You can do this through the GUI interface by browsing through available packages or by using the `yum search` command on the command line. The `yum search` command allows you to search for packages by name, description, or keywords.

### Step 4: Installing Software Packages

Now that you have identified the software packages you want to install, you can proceed with the installation process. On the GUI interface, simply select the package and click on the "Install" button. If you are using the command line, use the `yum install` command followed by the name of the package. This command will also install any necessary dependencies for the selected package.

### Step 5: Updating Software Packages

To keep your software packages up to date, it is important to regularly check for updates and install them as needed. You can do this through the GUI interface by clicking on the "Update" button for a specific package or by using the `yum update` command on the command line. The `yum update` command will check for updates for all installed packages and prompt you to install them.

### Step 6: Managing Repositories

In addition to Red Hat Network, you can also install and update software from remote repositories. These repositories contain software packages that are not available on RHN. To manage repositories on a Red Hat system, you can use the `yum-config-manager` command. This command allows you to enable or disable certain repositories, as well as add new ones.

### Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully learned how to install and update software packages from Red Hat Network. With this skill, you will be able to easily manage software on a Red Hat system and ensure that all packages are up to date. Remember to regularly check for updates and manage your repositories to ensure your system is running smoothly. Happy certifying!
