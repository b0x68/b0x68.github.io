# Tutorial: Installing and Updating Software Packages from Red Hat Network

In this tutorial, we will explain in great depth how to install and update software packages from Red Hat Network (RHN). This is an important topic as keeping your system up-to-date with the latest software packages is essential for maintaining system security and functionality.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need access to a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system and an active subscription to Red Hat Network. You will also need a basic understanding of the command line interface (CLI) and how to use package managers such as YUM or DNF.

## Introduction

Red Hat Network (RHN) is a software management and distribution platform provided by Red Hat. It allows system administrators to easily install and update software packages on their Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. RHN provides access to a vast library of certified and tested software packages, ensuring that your system is running the latest and most secure versions of software.

## Step 1: Registering your System with Red Hat Network

The first step is to register your system with Red Hat Network. This will allow your system to securely communicate with the RHN servers and access the software packages available.

To register your system, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your system as the root user.
2. Open a terminal and enter the command `subscription-manager register`.
3. You will be prompted to enter your Red Hat Network login credentials.
4. Once successfully registered, you will see a success message.

## Step 2: Managing System Software

Once your system is registered with Red Hat Network, you can start managing your software packages.

### Installing Software Packages

To install a software package from RHN, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your system as the root user.
2. Open a terminal and enter the command `yum install <package-name>`, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.
3. YUM will connect to the RHN servers and retrieve the necessary files. It will then prompt you to confirm the installation.
4. Enter 'y' to proceed with the installation.

The package will now be installed on your system. You can repeat these steps for any other packages you want to install.

### Updating Software Packages

To update a software package from RHN, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your system as the root user.
2. Open a terminal and enter the command `yum update <package-name>`, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to update.
3. YUM will connect to the RHN servers and retrieve the latest version of the package.
4. If a newer version is available, YUM will prompt you to confirm the update.
5. Enter 'y' to proceed with the update.

The package will now be updated to the latest version on your system. You can repeat these steps for any other packages you want to update.

### Searching for Software Packages

If you are not sure of the exact name of a package, or if you want to search for a specific package, you can use the `yum search <keyword>` command. This will search the RHN repository for any packages matching the keyword you entered.

### Removing Software Packages

To remove a software package from your system, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your system as the root user.
2. Open a terminal and enter the command `yum remove <package-name>`, replacing `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to remove.
3. YUM will prompt you to confirm the removal.
4. Enter 'y' to proceed with the removal.

The package will now be removed from your system.
