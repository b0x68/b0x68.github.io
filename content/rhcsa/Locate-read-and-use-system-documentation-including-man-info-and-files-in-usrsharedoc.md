# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc

System documentation is an essential aspect of managing and administering any operating system. As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA), it is crucial to be able to locate, read, and use system documentation effectively. In this tutorial, we will explore the objective of "Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc" in great depth.

## Understanding the Objective

The purpose of this objective is to enable the RHCSA to access and utilize system documentation for various tasks such as troubleshooting, installing packages, and configuring system components. The objective specifically mentions three resources - man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc. Let's take a closer look at each of these resources.

### Man Pages

Man, short for manual, is a documentation system found in Unix and Unix-like systems, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The man command displays the manual pages for a specific command or system component. These manual pages provide detailed information about the usage, options, and examples of the command or component.

### Info Pages

Info is another documentation system found in Unix and Unix-like systems. It is similar to man pages but provides more comprehensive and structured information about commands, system components, and configuration files. Info pages use a tree-like structure that allows for easier navigation and browsing of related topics. 

### Files in /usr/share/doc

Lastly, the objective mentions files in /usr/share/doc. This directory contains various system documentation files, such as README, CHANGELOG, and INSTALL, for installed packages. These files provide detailed information about the package, its version, dependencies, and installation instructions.

Now that we have a basic understanding of the resources mentioned in the objective let's look at how we can use them to achieve the objective.

## Locating System Documentation

As an RHCSA, you must know how to locate system documentation effectively. The following are some ways to locate relevant documentation:

- Use the man command with the desired topic to display the manual pages. For example, `man systemctl` will display the manual page for the systemctl command.
- Use the info command with the desired topic to display the info pages. For example, `info mount` will display the info pages for the mount command.
- Use the find command to locate files in the /usr/share/doc directory. For example, `find /usr/share/doc -name README` will display a list of all README files in the /usr/share/doc directory.

## Reading System Documentation

Once you have located the appropriate documentation, the next step is to read and understand it. Here are some tips for effective reading of system documentation:

- Start with the introductory sections, which typically provide an overview of the topic and its purpose.
- Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure used in the documentation.
- Pay attention to the options and their descriptions, as they provide valuable information about the functionality of the command or component.
- Look for examples provided in the documentation. These can help you understand how to use the command or configuration file in different scenarios.

## Using System Documentation

The final step in achieving the objective is to use the system documentation to perform tasks. Here are some ways to use system documentation effectively:

- Use the examples provided in the documentation to perform tasks.
- Refer to the options and their descriptions to use them appropriately.
- Look for links to related topics or commands in the documentation to expand your knowledge.
- In the case of files in the /usr/share/doc directory, refer to the installation instructions or CHANGELOG files for information on how to install or update the package.

## Conclusion

Being able to locate, read, and use system documentation is a crucial skill for any RHCSA. In this tutorial, we explored the objective of "Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc" in great depth. We discussed the resources mentioned in the objective - man, info, and files in /usr/share/doc and looked at ways to effectively locate, read, and use system documentation. With this knowledge, you will be able to perform various tasks and troubleshoot issues efficiently as an RHCSA.
