# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: "Processing Output of Shell Commands Within a Script" 

In this tutorial, we will cover the objective "Processing Output of Shell Commands Within a Script" from the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. This objective tests your understanding and ability to process output from shell commands within a script. Let's dive in!

## What is a Shell Command?

A shell command is a text-based interface provided by an operating system that allows users to interact with the system. It is a powerful tool for executing tasks on the command line and can be used to perform a variety of operations, from simple file manipulation to complex system administration tasks.

There are several different types of shell commands, including built-in commands, internal commands, and external commands. These commands have different functionalities and can be used in various ways to achieve a specific task.

## Why Is Understanding Shell Commands Important?

Shell commands are an essential aspect of system administration and automation. They allow you to perform tasks quickly and efficiently, making them an integral part of any script or automation process.

Understanding shell commands can also help you troubleshoot issues, analyze system performance, and gather information about your system. It is also a crucial skill for any Linux administrator, as it provides a foundation for more advanced tasks and script development.

Now that we understand the basics let's dive into how to process output from shell commands within a script.

## Processing Output of Shell Commands Within a Script

Processing output of shell commands within a script involves capturing the output of a command and using it as input for another command or for a specific task. This process is often referred to as piping, and it allows you to create a chain of commands that work together to achieve a specific goal.

To demonstrate this, let's look at an example. Say we want to find the number of files in a directory and then display that number to the user. We can use the `wc` command to count the number of lines in the output of the `ls` command.

The syntax for this would look like this:

`ls | wc -l`

The `|` symbol tells the system to take the output of the left command and pass it as input to the right command. In this case, the output of the `ls` command (a list of files in the directory) is passed to the `wc` command, which then counts the number of lines and returns the total.

We can then use this output in our script and display it to the user. This simple example illustrates the power and usefulness of processing the output of shell commands within a script.

## Redirecting Output to a File

In addition to piping output to another command, you can also redirect it to a file. This can be useful when you want to save the output for later use or analysis. There are two ways to redirect output to a file: 

#### 1. > symbol

The `>` symbol will redirect the output of a command to a file. It will overwrite any existing content in the file, so be careful when using it.

Example: `ls > file_list.txt`

This will create a file called `file_list.txt` and write the output of the `ls` command to it.

#### 2. >> symbol

The `>>` symbol will also redirect the output of a command to a file, but it will append it to any existing content in the file.

Example: `ls >> file_list.txt`

This will append the output of the `ls` command to the existing content in the `file_list.txt` file.

## Storing Output to a Variable

Another useful way to process the output of shell commands within a script is by storing it to a variable. Variables are used to store data and can be referenced multiple times in a script.

To store the output of a command to a variable, we use the `=` symbol. Let's look at an example. Say we want to find the number of lines in a file and store that number to a variable called `num_lines`. We can do that using the `wc` command with the `-l` option.

The syntax would look like this:

`num_lines=$(wc -l < file.txt)`

This will store the output of the `wc` command into the `num_lines` variable. We can then use this variable in our script as needed.

## Using Conditionals with Shell Command Output

Another way to process the output of shell commands within a script is by using conditional statements. These statements allow you to test for a specific condition and perform different actions based on the result.

For example, we can use the `grep` command to search for a specific string in a file and then use a conditional statement to determine if the string is present or not. If the string is present, we can output a success message. Otherwise, we can output an error message.

The syntax would look like this:

```
if grep -q "search_string" file.txt; then
    echo "String found, operation successful."
else
    echo "String not found, operation failed."
fi
```

This is just one example of how you can use conditionals with shell command output within a script. They can be useful for automating tasks and performing different actions based on the output of a command.

## Conclusion

Processing output of shell commands within a script is an essential skill for any Linux administrator and is also a crucial aspect of the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200. By understanding how to pipe, redirect, store, and use conditional statements with command output, you can streamline your scripting and automation processes and effectively manage your system.

We hope this tutorial has helped you gain a better understanding of this objective. Remember to practice and experiment with different shell commands to become more familiar with them. Good luck on your exam!
