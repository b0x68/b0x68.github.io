# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes

In this tutorial, we will be discussing how to identify and kill CPU/memory intensive processes on a Red Hat system. As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, it is important to have a thorough understanding of how to manage system resources effectively. This objective is key in ensuring your system is running smoothly and efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of the Linux command line and have root privileges on your Red Hat system. It is also recommended to have some knowledge of process management and system administration.

## Step 1: Understanding the Basics
Before we dig into identifying and killing processes, it is essential to have a basic understanding of system resources and processes on a Linux system.

**System Resources:** 

A computer system has a finite amount of resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. These resources are shared among running processes and need to be managed effectively.

**Processes:**

A process is an instance of a running program on a Linux system. Every command or application that is running on your system is a process. Each process has a unique process ID (PID) and consumes system resources. 

## Step 2: Identifying CPU/Memory Intensive Processes

Now, let's learn how to identify processes that are using high CPU or memory resources on your Red Hat system. We will be using different tools to accomplish this task.

**1. top Command:**

The 'top' command is a popular tool used for monitoring system processes. It displays a dynamic view of running processes and their resource usage. To access the top command, simply type 'top' into your terminal. You will see a list of processes sorted by the CPU utilization by default. 

To sort processes by memory usage, press 'M' from your keyboard. This will organize the processes from highest to lowest memory usage. You can also use the 'F' key to add or remove additional columns such as RAM, PID, CPU, etc.

**2. ps Command:**

The 'ps' command can also be used to view processes and their attributes. It provides a snapshot view of currently running processes. To view all processes, type 'ps -ef' in your terminal. 

To list processes in descending order of CPU or memory usage, use the 'ps -ef --sort=-pcpu' or 'ps -ef --sort=-pmem' command respectively.

**3. htop Command:**

The 'htop' command is an interactive version of the 'top' command. It provides a detailed view of running processes with color-coded display. To install and use htop on your Red Hat system, run the following commands:

```
# yum install htop 
# htop
```

## Step 3: Killing Processes

Once we have identified CPU/memory intensive processes, our next step is to terminate those processes to free up system resources. It is crucial to understand that killing a process may have an impact on the performance of your system and should be done carefully.

To kill a process, you will need to know its PID, which can be found by using the 'top', 'ps', or 'htop' command. Once you have the PID, you can use the 'kill' command followed by the PID to kill the process.

```
# kill <PID>
```

If the process is still running, you can use the 'kill -9 <PID>' command to force kill it. 

## Step 4: Bonus Tips

- For managing multiple processes, use the 'killall' command instead of killing them one by one.
- You can also use the 'nice' command to change the priority of a process. By default, processes have a priority of 0, and using the nice command, you can increase or decrease the priority level.
- Use the 'renice' command to change the priority of a running process.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have discussed how to identify and kill CPU/memory intensive processes on a Red Hat system. As a Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator, it is essential to have a good understanding of managing system resources to ensure your system is running efficiently. We hope this tutorial has helped you prepare for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective on identifying and killing processes.
