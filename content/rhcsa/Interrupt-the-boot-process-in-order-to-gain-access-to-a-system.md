# Tutorial: Interrupting the Boot Process to Gain Access to a System
 
The Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objective focuses on the importance of being able to interrupt the boot process of a system in order to gain access. This skill is essential for system administrators as it allows them to troubleshoot and fix any issues that may arise during the boot process, as well as gain access to the system if necessary. In this tutorial, we will cover all the steps required to successfully interrupt the boot process and gain access to a system.

## What is the Boot Process?

Before we dive into the tutorial, let's first understand what the boot process is. The boot process is the series of events that occur when a computer is powered on and starts up. This process is responsible for loading the operating system, initializing hardware components, and starting services and applications. The boot process has several stages, including the BIOS, boot loader, and kernel. It is crucial to understand the boot process to be able to interrupt it successfully.

## Why Interrupt the Boot Process?

There are several reasons why a system administrator may need to interrupt the boot process. The most common reason is to troubleshoot issues that may arise during boot up, such as a kernel panic or system error. By interrupting the boot process, the administrator can access the system and diagnose and fix the issue. Another reason to interrupt the boot process is to gain access to the system in case the login credentials are not working or if there is a need to access the system in single-user mode.

## Steps to Interrupt the Boot Process

Now, let's get into step-by-step instructions on how to successfully interrupt the boot process and gain access to a system.

### Step 1: Power on the System

The first step is to power on the system. Make sure that the system is connected to a power source and turned on.

### Step 2: Access the GRUB Menu

The GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is responsible for loading the Linux kernel and initial RAM disk. To interrupt the boot process, we need to access the GRUB menu. When the system is booting up, press any key (usually Esc or Shift) to access the GRUB menu. If the system is not set up to show the GRUB menu by default, you can edit the GRUB configuration file to enable it.

### Step 3: Edit the Boot Menu Entry

Once you have accessed the GRUB menu, you will see a list of boot options. Locate the boot menu entry for the operating system you want to interrupt (usually the first one). Press the 'e' key to edit the boot menu entry.

### Step 4: Add the 'init' Command

In the boot menu entry, find the line that starts with "* linux". At the end of this line, add the keyword 'init=/bin/bash'. This will tell the system to boot into single-user mode and launch a bash shell for us to gain access.

### Step 5: Boot into Single-User Mode

Now, press 'Ctrl+x' or 'F10' to boot with the changes made to the boot menu entry. The system will boot into single-user mode, and you will see a bash shell prompt.

### Step 6: Remount the Root Filesystem

In single-user mode, the root filesystem is mounted as 'read-only' to avoid any accidental changes. We need to remount it as 'read-write' to make any changes. To do this, use the command:

```
mount -o remount,rw /
```

### Step 7: Change Password (Optional)

If your goal is to gain access to the system, you can now change the password by using the 'passwd' command. Enter a new password when prompted.

### Step 8: Make Necessary Changes

Now that you have access to the system, you can make any necessary changes or troubleshoot any issues that may have caused you to interrupt the boot process.

### Step 9: Exit Single-User Mode

Once you have made all the necessary changes, you can exit single-user mode and continue with the boot process. To do this, use the command:

```
exec /sbin/init
```

This will start the normal boot process and bring you to the login screen.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered all the steps required to interrupt the boot process and gain access to a system. As a system administrator, it is essential to have the knowledge and skills to perform this task successfully. By following these steps, you can troubleshoot and fix any boot issues that may arise, as well as gain access to the system in case of login or other access issues.
