# Tutorial: Interrupting the Boot Process to Gain Access to a System

Welcome to our tutorial on how to interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system, as required for the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator (RHCSA) Exam 200. In this tutorial, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to interrupt the boot process on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system and gain access to it.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to have the following:

- Access to a RHEL system
- Basic knowledge of Linux and the boot process
- Familiarity with command line interface (CLI) and some basic commands
- A user account with administrator privileges on the RHEL system

## Understanding the Boot Process

Before we learn how to interrupt the boot process, it is important to understand how the boot process works. When a computer is powered on, it goes through a series of steps to load the operating system (OS) and make it available for use. This process is known as the boot process.

The boot process consists of several stages, with each stage responsible for loading different components of the OS. These stages include the BIOS, the boot loader, the initialization process, and the kernel. Once the kernel is loaded, it takes over and starts the OS. During this process, there are certain points where interrupting the process can give you access to the system.

## Interrupting the Boot Process

Now, let's go through the steps to interrupt the boot process and gain access to a RHEL system.

1. Start or restart the RHEL system. As the system is booting up, press the **Escape** key on your keyboard to access the GRUB boot menu. GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) is the boot loader used in RHEL, which allows you to select the OS to boot from.

2. Once the GRUB boot menu appears, use the arrow keys to highlight the kernel you want to boot and press **e** to edit its settings.

3. This will bring up the kernel parameters screen. Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line starting with `linux` and press **End** or use the arrow keys to move to the end of that line.

4. At the end of the line, add `rd.break` to the end of the line. This will interrupt the boot process before the initialization process starts.

5. Press **Ctrl + X** or **F10** to boot with the modified kernel parameters.

6. This will bring you to a shell prompt with the **switch_root:/#**. The root file system is mounted as read-only at this point.

7. Remount the root file system with read/write permissions by running the command `mount -o remount,rw /sysroot`.

8. Next, change the root to the new root by running the command `chroot /sysroot`.

9. Now you can make any necessary changes to the system, such as resetting passwords or modifying configurations.

## Recovering from Changes

After you have made the necessary changes, you must exit and reboot the system for the changes to take effect. To exit the chroot environment, enter the command `exit`. Then, exit the root file system by entering the command `exit` again.

Once the system has rebooted, you can log in with the modified credentials or access the modified configurations.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully interrupted the boot process and gained access to a RHEL system. This skill is essential for any RHCSA certified professional, as it allows you to troubleshoot and recover from various boot-related issues.

In this tutorial, we have covered the steps to interrupt the boot process and make changes on a RHEL system. We also explained the importance of understanding the boot process and provided a brief overview of the stages involved.

Thank you for following along with our tutorial. We hope it has been helpful and wish you success on the RHCSA Exam 200.
