# Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally

Hello and welcome to this tutorial on how to boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally. This topic is a part of the Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 objectives and it is important to have a thorough understanding of these processes in order to pass the exam. So, let's get started!

## What is Booting, Rebooting, and Shutting Down?

Booting is the process of starting up a computer system. This involves loading the operating system and other essential components into the computer's memory. Rebooting, also known as restarting, is the process of resetting a computer system after it has been running. This is often done when there are software or hardware issues that require a fresh start. Shutting down is the process of closing all programs and services and powering off the computer system. This is usually done when you are done using the system or want to conserve power.

## Booting a System Normally

To boot a system normally, follow these steps:

1. Press the power button to turn on the computer. The computer's BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) will start the boot process.
2. The BIOS will perform a Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check the system's hardware components such as the processor, memory, and hard drives. If any errors are detected, the BIOS will generate error messages.
3. The BIOS will then look for a bootable device, such as the hard drive or a CD/DVD, to load the operating system from.
4. Once the operating system is loaded, the login screen will appear and you can log in to your user account.

Congratulations, you have successfully booted your system normally!

## Rebooting a System Normally

To reboot a system normally, follow these steps:

1. Save any unsaved work and close all open programs.
2. Click on the "Start" button and select "Restart". This will initiate the reboot process.
3. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + Del" and select "Restart" from the options.
4. The system will go through the reboot process, similar to the booting process, and will eventually bring you back to the login screen.
5. Log in to your user account and you are now using a freshly rebooted system.

## Shutting Down a System Normally

To shut down a system normally, follow these steps:

1. Save any unsaved work and close all open programs.
2. Click on the "Start" button and select "Shut down". This will initiate the shutdown process.
3. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + Alt + Del" and select "Shut down" from the options.
4. A confirmation prompt will appear asking if you are sure you want to shut down the system. Click "Yes" to proceed.
5. The system will close all programs and services and then power off.

Congratulations, you have successfully shut down your system normally!

## Troubleshooting Boot, Reboot, and Shutdown Issues

If you encounter any issues while booting, rebooting, or shutting down your system, here are a few common troubleshooting steps you can try:

- Check if all hardware components, such as the power supply, are properly connected.
- Check if the BIOS settings are correct and there are no errors.
- Check if any software or drivers are causing the issue.
- Try booting or rebooting in Safe Mode, which loads a limited set of drivers and services.
- If the system fails to shut down, try manually powering it off by pressing and holding the power button for a few seconds.

If you are still unable to resolve the issue, it is best to seek professional help or consult the Red Hat documentation for further guidance.
