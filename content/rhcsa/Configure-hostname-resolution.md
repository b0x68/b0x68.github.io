# Red Hat Certified Systems Administrator Exam 200 Objective: Configure Hostname Resolution

Hostname resolution is the process of mapping a human-readable hostname to an IP address. This is a crucial step in connecting to devices and services on a network. In this tutorial, we will explain the steps to configure hostname resolution in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).

## Prerequisites
In order to successfully configure hostname resolution, you will need:
- A Red Hat Enterprise Linux system (version 7 or above) 
- Basic knowledge of networking and Linux command line 

## Step 1: Understanding the Hostname
The hostname is the unique name given to a device on a network. It is used to identify and connect to that device. The hostname can be a combination of letters, numbers, and hyphens, but it cannot contain spaces. By default, RHEL assigns the hostname as "localhost.localdomain". To view your system's current hostname, type the following command in the terminal:
```
hostname
```
To change the hostname, you can use the `hostnamectl` command with the `set-hostname` option as follows:
```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <new-hostname>
```
## Step 2: Editing the Hosts File
The hosts file is a simple text file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is located at **/etc/hosts** and contains entries in the format of `<IP address> <hostname>`. To edit the file, use a text editor such as **vi** or **nano**:
```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```
At the end of the file, add an entry for your system's hostname and IP address, for example:
```
192.168.1.1   myhostname
```

## Step 3: Configuring DNS 
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system that translates domain names (e.g. example.com) to their corresponding IP addresses. By default, RHEL uses DNS to resolve hostnames. To configure DNS, follow these steps:
1. Install the **bind** package: 
```
sudo yum install bind
```
2. Open the configuration file **/etc/resolv.conf** using a text editor:
```
sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
```
3. Add the IP addresses of your DNS servers in the following format:
```
nameserver <IP address>
```
4. Save and close the file.

## Step 4: Testing the Configuration
To test if the hostname resolution is configured correctly, use the `ping` command followed by the hostname or IP address. For example:
```
ping myhostname
```
If you receive a response from the IP address of your system, then the resolution is working properly.

## Step 5: Persistent Configuration
To ensure that the changes made in the previous steps persist after reboot, you will need to make some additional configurations:
- For **hostname**: Edit the file **/etc/hostname** and add your system's hostname in a single line.
- For **hosts file**: Add your system's hostname and IP address in the same format as in Step 2, but also include "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain" to the same line, for example:
```
192.168.1.1   myhostname localhost localhost.localdomain
```
- For **DNS configuration**: Edit the file **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0** (or your network interface) and add the IP addresses of your DNS servers in the `DNS1=` and `DNS2=` options.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully configured hostname resolution in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This is a crucial step in establishing connectivity within a network and will be beneficial for your RHEL certification exam. Remember to practice and review your configurations regularly to improve your skills.
